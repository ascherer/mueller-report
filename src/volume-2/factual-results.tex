\subsection{The President’s Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9, 2016 Meeting Between Russians and Senior Campaign Officials}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Overview}
\end{center}

By June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory information on Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”
On multiple occasions in late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails, and he then dictated a statement about the meeting to be issued by Donald Trump Jr. describing the meeting as about adoption.

\subsubsection{The President Learns About the Existence of Emails Concerning the June 9; 2016 Trump Tower Meeting}

In mid-June 2017—the same weekthat the Presidentfirst asked Lewandowski to pass a message to Sessions—senior Administration officials became aware of emails exchanged during the campaign arranging a meeting between Donald TrumpJr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and a Russian attorney.“ As described in VolumeI, Section IV.A.5, supra, the emails stated that the “Crown [P]rosecutor of Russia” had offered “to provide the Trump campaign with someofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia”as part of“Russiaanditsgovernment’ssupportforMr.Trump.”°* TrumpJr.responded,“[I]fit’swhat you say I loveit,”°® and he, Kushner, and Manafort met with the Russian attorney and several other Russian individuals at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.%
At the meeting, the Russian attorney claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, and the Russian attorney then spoke about the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. statute that imposedfinancial andtravel sanctions on Russianofficials and that had resultedin a retaliatory ban in Russia on U.S. adoptionsof Russian children.°

Accordingto written answers submitted by the President in response to questions from this Office, the President had norecollection of learning of the meeting or the emails setting it up at the time the meeting occurred or at any othertime before the election.°

The Trump Campaign had previously received a documentrequest from SSCTthat called for the production of various information, including, “[a] list and a description of all meetings” between any “individual affiliated with the Trump campaign” and “any individual formally or informally affiliated with the Russian governmentor Russian business interests which tookplace between June 16, 2015, and 12 pm on January 20, 2017,” and associated records.%
Trump Organization attorneys became aware ofthe June 9 meeting nolaterthan the first week of June 2017, when they began interviewing the meeting participants, and the Trump Organization attorneys providedthe emails setting up the meeting to the President’s personal counsel.°” Mark Corallo, who had been hired as a spokesmanfor the President’s personal legal team,recalled that he learned aboutthe June 9 meeting around June 21 or 22, 2017.97! Priebusrecalled learning about the June 9 meeting from Fox Newshost Sean Hannity in late June 2017.5? Priebus notified one ofthePresident’spersonalattorneys,whotoldPriebushewasalreadyworkingonit.5Bylate June, several advisors recalled receiving media inquiries that could relate to the June 9 meeting.674

\subsubsection{The President Directs Communications Staff Not to Publicly Disclose Information About the June 9 Meeting}

Communications advisors Hope Hicks and Josh Raffel recalled discussing with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trumpthat the emails were damaging and would inevitably be leaked.®” Hicks and Raffel advised that the best strategy wasto proactively release the emailsto the press.” On or about June 22, 2017, Hicks attended a meeting in the White House residence with the President, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump.°”” According to Hicks, Kushnersaid that he wantedtofill thePresidentinonsomethingthathadbeendiscoveredinthedocumentshewastoprovidetothe congressional committees involving a meeting with him, Manafort, and Trump Jr.978 Kushner brought a folder of documents to the meeting andtried to show them to the President, but the President stopped Kushner andsaid he did not want to know aboutit, shutting the conversation down.”

On June 28, 2017, Hicks viewed the emails at Kushner’s attorney’s office.*° She recalled beingshockedbytheemailsbecausetheylooked“reallybad.”°*! Thenextday,Hicksspoke privately with the President to mention her concern about the emails, which she understood were soon going to be shared with Congress.” The President seemed upset because too many people knewabouttheemailsandhetoldHicksthatjustonelawyershoulddealwiththematter.The President indicated that he did not think the emails wouldleak, but said they would leak ifeveryone had accessto them.°**

Later that day, Hicks, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump wenttogetherto talk to the President.*° Hicksrecalled that Kushner told the President the June 9 meeting wasnot a big deal and was about Russian adoption, but that emails existed setting up the meeting.®** Hicks said she wanted to get in front of the story and have TrumpJr. release the emails as part of an interview with “softball questions.”®*’ ThePresidentsaidhedidnotwanttoknowaboutitandtheyshouldnotgotothe press.°*8 Hicks warned the President that the emails were “really bad” and the story would be “massive” when it broke, but the President was insistent that he did not wantto talk about it and said he did not want details.’ Hicks recalled that the President asked Kushner when his document production was due.®° Kushner responded that it would be a couple of weeks and the President said, “then leaveit alone.”©?! Hicksalso recalled that the President said Kushner’s attorney should give the emails to whomever heneeded to give them to, but the President did not think they would be leaked to the press.Raffel later heard from Hicksthat the President had directed the group not to be proactivein disclosing the emails because the President believed they would not leak.°TM

\subsubsection{The President Directs Trump Jr.’s Response to Press Inquiries About the June 9 Meeting}

The following week, the President departed on an overseastrip for the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, accompanied by Hicks, Raffel, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump, amongothers.°* On July 7, 2017, while the President was overseas, Hicks and Raffel learned that the New York Times was working ona story about the June 9 meeting.”° The next day, Hickstold the President about the story and hedirected her not to comment.® Hicks thought the President’s reaction was oddbecauseheusuallyconsiderednotrespondingtothepresstobetheultimatesin.” Laterthat day, Hicks andthe President again spoke aboutthe story.*”* Hicksrecalled that the President asked her what the meeting had been about, and she said that she had been told the meeting was about Russianadoption.® ThePresidentresponded,“thenjustsaythat.”7°°

Ontheflight home from the G20 on July 8, 2017, Hicks obtained a draft statement about themeetingtobereleasedbyTrumpJr.andbroughtittothePresident.’ Thedraftstatement began with a reference to the information that was offered by the Russians in setting up the meeting: “I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.””” Hicks again wanted to disclose the entire story, but the Presidentdirected that the statement notbe
issued becauseit said too much.”°? The President told Hicks to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief meeting and it was about Russian adoption.”TM After speaking with the President, Hicks texted TrumpJr. a revised statementon the June 9 meeting that read:

It was a short meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issueat that time and there was no follow up.”

Hicks’s text concluded, “Are you ok with this? Attributed to you.””° Trump Jr. responded by text message that he wanted to add the word “primarily” before “discussed” so that the statement wouldread,“WeprimarilydiscussedaprogramabouttheadoptionofRussianchildren.”?°? Trump Jr. texted that he wanted the change because “[t]hey started with some Hillary thing which wasbs and some other nonsense which we shot downfast.””°8 Hicks texted back,“I think that’s right too butbossmanworrieditinvitesalotofquestions[.] [U]Itimately[d]efertoyouand[yourattorney] on that word Be I know it’s important andI think the mention of a campaign issue adds something toitincasewehavetogofurther.””” TrumpJr.responded,“IfIdon’thaveitinthereitappears asthoughI’mlyinglaterwhentheyinevitablyleaksomething.””!?TrumpJr.’sstatement—adding the word “primarily” and making other minor additions—was then provided to the New York Times.”!! The full statement provided to the Timesstated:

We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government,butit was not a campaign issue atthe time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.”!

ThestatementdidnotmentiontheofferofderogatoryinformationaboutClintonoranydiscussion of the Magnitsky Act or U.S. sanctions, which were the principal subjects of the meeting, as described in VolumeI, Section IV.A.5, supra.

A short while later, while still on Air Force One, Hicks learned that Priebus knew about the emails, which further convincedherthat additional information aboutthe June 9 meeting would leakandtheWhiteHouseshouldbeproactiveandgetinfrontofthestory.”'3 Hicksrecalledagain going to the President to urge him that they should be fully transparent about the June 9 meeting, but he again said no,telling Hicks, “You’ve given a statement. We’re done.”7"4

Later on the flight home, Hicks went to the President’s cabin, where the President was on the phone with oneof his personal attorneys.’!> At one point the President handedthe phoneto Hicks,andtheattorneytoldHicksthathehadbeenworkingwithCircaNewsonaseparatestory, and that she should not talk to the New York Times.7!®

\subsubsection{The Media Reports on the June 9, 2016 Meeting}

Before the President’s flight home from the G20 landed, the New York Times published its story about the June 9, 2016 meeting.’!” In addition to the statement from TrumpJr., the Times story also quoted a statement from Corallo on behalf of the President’s legal team suggesting that the meeting might have been a setup by individuals working with the firm that producedthe Steele reporting.”'® Corallo also worked with Circa News on a story published an hourlater that questioned whether Democratic operatives had arranged the June 9 meeting to create the appearance of improper connections between Russia and Trump family members.’!? Hicks was upset about Corallo’s public statement and called him that evening to say the President had not approved the statement.’”°

The next day, July 9, 2017, Hicks and the President called Corallo together and the PresidentcriticizedCoralloforthestatementhehadreleased.””! CorallotoldthePresidentthe statement had been authorized and further observed that TrumpJr.’s statement was inaccurate and that a documentexisted that would contradictit.”? Corallo said that he purposely used the term “document”to refer to the emails setting up the June 9 meeting because he did not know whatthe President knew about the emails.” Corallo recalled that when he referred to the “document” on the call with the President, Hicks responded that only a few people had accessto it and said “it will never get out.”’** Corallo took contemporaneous notes of the call that say: “Also mention existenceofdoc. Hopesays‘onlyafewpeoplehaveit.

On July 11, 2017, TrumpJr. posted redacted images ofthe emails setting up the June 9 meeting on Twitter; the New York Timesreported that he did so “[a]fter being told that The Times was aboutto publish the content of the emails.””” Later that day, the media reported that the President had been personally involved in preparing TrumpJr.’s initial statement to the New York Times that had claimed the meeting “primarily” concerned “a program about the adoption of Russian children.”’”8 Over the next several days, the President’s personal counselrepeatedly and inaccurately denied that the President played any role in drafting Trump Jr.’s statement.”° After consulting with the President on the issue, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told the media that the President “certainly didn’t dictate” the statement, but that “he weighed in, offered suggestionslike any father would do.””° Several monthslater, the President’s personal counsel stated in a private communication to the Special Counsel’s Office that “the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Timesarticle on behalf of his son, Donald Trump,

\textbf{Analysis}
\end{center}

In analyzing the President’s actions regarding the disclosure of information aboutthe June 9 meeting, the following evidenceis relevantto the elements ofobstruction ofjustice:

Obstructive act. On at least three occasions between June 29, 2017, and July 9, 2017, the President directed Hicks and others not to publicly disclose information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney. On June 29, Hicks warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were“really bad” and the story would be “massive” when it broke, but the President told her and Kushnerto “leave it alone.” Early on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about the June 9 meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the Presidentusuallyconsiderednotrespondingtothepresstobetheultimatesin. Laterthatday,the Presidentrejected TrumpJr.’s draft statement that would have acknowledgedthat the meeting was with “an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.” The President then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption (which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement dictated by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton.

EachoftheseeffortsbythePresidentinvolvedhiscommunicationsteamandwasdirected at the press. They would amountto obstructive acts only ifthe President, by taking these actions, soughtto withhold information from or mislead congressionalinvestigators or the Special Counsel. On May 17, 2017, the President’s campaign received a document request from SSCIthat clearly covered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have beenrelevantto the Special Counsel’s investigation.

But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special Counsel. Theseries of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and preventtheir public release occurred in the context of developing a press strategy. The only evidence we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when Hicks recalled the President acknowledging that Kushner’s attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to whomeverheneededtogivethemto. WedonothaveevidenceofwhatthePresidentdiscussed with his own lawyersat that time.

Nexusto an official proceeding. As described above,by the time ofthe President’s attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge, and the President had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the nexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to showthat preventing the release of the emails to the public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does notestablish that the President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official proceedings.

Intent. The evidence establishes the President’s substantial involvementin the communicationsstrategy related to information about his campaign’s connections to Russia and his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The President became aware of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017, when lawyers for the Trump Organization began interviewing witnesses whoparticipated in the June 9 meeting. The President thereafterrepeatedlyrejectedtheadviceofHicksandotherstafferstopubliclyreleaseinformation about the June 9 meeting. The President expressed concern that multiple people had accessto the emails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And the President dictatedastatementtobereleasedbyTrumpJr.inresponsetothefirstpressaccountsoftheJune 9 meetingthat said the meeting was aboutadoption.

But as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to prevent the Special Counsel’s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9 meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement recorded by Corallo—that the emails “will never get out”—can be explained asreflecting a belief that the emails would not be made public if the President’s press strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to Congress and the Special Counsel.

\subsection{The President’s Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Over the Investigation}

Overview

From summer 2017 through 2018, the President attempted to have Attorney General Sessions reverse his recusal, take control of the Special Counsel’s investigation, and order an investigation of Hillary Clinton.

Evidence

\subsubsection{The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal}

After returning Sessions’s resignation letter at the end of May 2017, but before the President’s July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in whichhepublicly criticized Sessions for recusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessionsreverse hisrecusal.Inparticular,atsomepointaftertheMay17,2017appointmentoftheSpecialCounsel, Sessions recalled, the President called him at home and asked if Sessions would “unrecuse” himself.”2° According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Departmentof Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the “gist” of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from “allofit,” including the Special Counsel’s Russia investigation.’ Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did not reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton.”*

In early July 2017, the President asked Staff Secretary Rob Porter what he thought of Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand.” Porterrecalled that the President asked him ifBrand was good, tough, and “on the team.””° The President also asked if Porter thought Brand was interested in being responsible for the Special Counsel’s investigation and whether she would want to be Attorney General one day.”! Because Porter knew Brand, the President asked him to sound her out about taking responsibility for the investigation and being Attorney General.”? Contemporaneousnotestaken by Porter show thatthe President told Porterto “Keep in touch with yourfriend,” in reference to Brand.” Later, the President asked Porter a few times in passing whetherhe had spokento Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task.”“4 In asking him to reach out to Brand, Porter understood the President to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel, although the President never said so explicitly.° Porter did not contact Brand because he wassensitive to the implicationsofthatactionanddidnotwanttobeinvolvedinachainofeventsassociatedwithan effort to end the investigation orfire the Special Counsel.”4°

McGahnrecalledthatduringthesummerof2017,heandthePresidentdiscussedthefact thatifSessionswerenolongerinhispositiontheSpecialCounselwouldreportdirectlytoanon- recused Attorney General.’ McGahntold the President that things might not change much under a new Attorney General.”48 McGahnalso recalled that in or around July 2017, the President frequently brought up his displeasure with Sessions.” Hicks recalled that the President viewed Sessions’srecusalfromtheRussiainvestigationasanactofdisloyalty.’°° Inadditiontocriticizing Sessions’s recusal, the President raised other concerns about Sessions and his job performance with McGahnand Hicks.’*!

\subsubsection{Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered by his Recusal}

Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who would notbe recused.

On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the Departmentof Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the Departmentshould be investigating.””? According to contemporaneousnotes taken by Porter, who wasat the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton’s emails and said, “Don’t havetotell us, just take [a] look.””°? Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the Department of Justice would comply with that request.’** Two days later, on October 18, 2017, the President tweeted, “Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many peoplenot interviewed,
including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?””*° On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was “ANGER & UNITY”over a “lack of investigation” of Clinton and “the Comey fix,” and concluded: “DO SOMETHING!”

On December6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end of a cabinet meeting.”"’ During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President again suggested that Sessions could “unrecuse,” which Porterlinked to taking back supervision of the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton.”* According to contemporaneousnotestaken by Porter, the President said, “I don’t know ifyou could un-recuse yourself. You’d be a hero. Nottelling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUScan get involved. CanorderAGtoinvestigate. Idon’twanttogetinvolved. I’mnotgoingtogetinvolved. I’m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.””* According to Porter’s notes, Sessions responded, “We are taking steps; whole new leadership team. Professionals; will operate according to the law.””°° Sessions also said, “I never saw anything that was improper,” which Porter thought was noteworthy becauseit did notfit with the previous discussion about Clinton.”°! Porter understood Sessions to be reassuring the President that he wason the President’s team.’

At the end of December, the President told the New York Times it was “too bad”that SessionshadrecusedhimselffromtheRussiainvestigation.’ WhenaskedwhetherHolderhad been a moreloyal Attorney General to President Obama than Sessions was to him, the President said, “I don’t wantto get into loyalty, but I will tell you that, I will say this: Holder protected President Obama. Totally protected him. When youlookatthe things that they did, and Holder protected the president. And I have greatrespect for that, ’ll be honest.””** Later in January, the PresidentbroughtuptheideaofreplacingSessionsandtoldPorterthathewantedto“cleanhouse” at the DepartmentofJustice.” In a meeting in the White House residence that Porter attended on January 27, 2018, Porter recalled that the President talked about the great attorneyshe had in the past with successful win records, such as Roy Cohn and Jay Goldberg, and said that one of his biggest failings as President was that he had not surrounded himself with good attorneys, citing Sessions as an example.”° The President raised Sessions’s recusal and brought up andcriticized the Special Counsel’s investigation.”

Overthe next several months, the President continued to criticize Sessions in tweets and media interviews and on several occasions appeared to publicly encourage him to take action in the Russia investigation despite his recusal.”* On June 5, 2018, for example, the President tweeted, “The Russian Witch Hunt Hoaxcontinues,all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself. ... I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined . . . and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!”” On August 1, 2018, the President tweeted that “Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Huntright now.”’”° On August 23, 2018, the President publicly criticized Sessions in a press interview and suggested that prosecutions at the Department of Justice were politically motivated because Paul Manafort had been prosecuted but Democrats had not.’””! ThePresidentsaid,“IputinanAttorneyGeneralthatnevertookcontroloftheJustice Department,JeffSessions.”””? Thatday,Sessionsissueda pressstatementthatsaid,“Itookcontrol oftheDepartmentofJusticethedayIwasswornin.... WhileIamAttorneyGeneral,theactions ofthe DepartmentofJustice will not be improperly influencedbypolitical considerations.”””3 The next day, the President tweeted a response: “‘Department of Justice will not be improperly influencedbypolitical considerations.’ Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the ‘other side’ including deleted Emails, Comey lies & leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation,illegal surveillance of Trump campaign, Russian collusion by Dems— and so much more. Open up the papers & documents without redaction? ComeonJeff, you can doit, the country is waiting!”””

On November7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, the President replaced Sessions with Sessions’s chiefofstaffas Acting Attorney General.””

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control ofthe Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidenceare relevant to the elements of obstruction ofjustice:

Obstructive act. To determine if the President’s efforts to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into accountthe supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General’s recusal covered other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not turn on what Attorney General Sessions would actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally havehadthe effect ofimpeding the Russia investigation.

On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessionsrecalled the President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did nottake it as a directive. When the President raised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by Porter, “Nottelling you to do anything. ... I’m not going to get involved. I’m not going to do anything or direct you todoanything. Ijustwanttobetreatedfairly.” ThedurationofthePresident’sefforts—which spanned from March 2017 to August 2018—andthefact that the President repeatedly criticized Sessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would haveto recuse is relevant to assessing whetherthe President’s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as obstructive acts.

Nexusto an official proceeding. As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence ofagrandjuryinvestigationsupervisedbytheSpecialCounselwaspublicknowledge. Inaddition, in July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the District of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August 2017.7 Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the obstructive-act element.

Intent. There is evidence that at least one purpose ofthe President’s conduct toward Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a waythatwouldrestrictitsscope. Bythesummerof2017,thePresidentwasawarethattheSpecial Counsel was investigating him personally for obstruction ofjustice. And in the wake ofthe disclosures of emails about the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the campaign, see Volume II, Section II.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the campaign now included the President’s son, son-in-law, and former campaign manager. The President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announcethat the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference. Yet Sessions remained recused. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to Sessionsin the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if he unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President’s desire that Sessions take back supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary Clinton. The President said in that meeting that he “just want[ed] to be treated fairly,” which could reflect his perception that it was unfairthat he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a principal effect of that act would be to restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the
Attorney General—aposition that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by someonelike Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their presidents. A reasonable inference from those statements and the President’s actionsis that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.

\subsection{The President Orders McGahn to Deny that the President Tried to Fire the Special Counsel}

Overview

In late January 2018, the media reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered McGahnto have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn had refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the President, through his personal counseland two aides, sought to have McGahndenythat he had beendirected to remove the Special Counsel. Each time he was approached, McGahnrespondedthat he would notrefute the press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President’s effort to have the Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahnin the Oval Office withonlytheChiefofStaffpresentandtriedtogetMcGahntosaythatthePresidentneverordered him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President’s direction to remove the Special Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President challenged McGahnfor taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had told Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed.

Evidence

\subsubsection{The Press Reports that the President Tried to Fire the Special Counsel}

On January 25, 2018, the New York Timesreported that in June 2017, the President had ordered McGahnto havethe DepartmentofJustice fire the Special Counsel.””” Accordingto the article, “[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation.”””* The article further reported that “[a]fter
receiving the president’s orderto fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel .. .

refused to askthe
dismissed the story when asked aboutit by reporters, saying, “Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Times fake story.””*!

The next day, the Washington Post reported on the same eventbut added that McGahn had nottold the Presidentdirectly that he intendedto resign rather than carry out the directive to have the Special Counsel terminated.”*? In that respect, the Post story clarified the Times story, which could be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President ofhis intention to quit, causing the President to back down from the order to have the Special Counselfired.”

\subsubsection{The President Seeks to Have McGahn Dispute the Press Reports}

On January 26, 2018, the President’s personal counsel called McGahn’sattorney andsaid that the President wanted McGahnto put out a statement denying that he had been askedtofire the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest.”** McGahn’s attorney spoke with McGahnabout that request and then called the President’s personal counselto relay that McGahn wouldnotmakea statement.’”*> McGahn’sattorneyinformedthePresident’spersonalcounselthat the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed.” Accordingly, McGahn’sattorney said, although the article was inaccurate in some other respects, McGahn could not comply with the President’s request to dispute the story.’*” HicksrecalledrelayingtothePresidentthatoneofhisattorneyshadspokentoMcGahn’sattorney aboutthe issue.”**

Also on January 26, 2017, Hicks recalled that the President asked Sanders to contact McGahnaboutthestory.”° McGahntoldSanderstherewasnoneedtorespondandindicatedthat someofthe article was accurate.” Consistent with that position, McGahn did not correct the Times story.

ThePresidentalsotold PriebusthatthePresidenthad“neversaidanyofthosethingsabout”theSpecialCounsel.’

The next day, on February 5, 2018, the President complained about the Times article to Porter.” The President told Porter that the article was “bullshit” and he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel.” The President said that McGahn leaked to the media to make himselflookgood.”° ThePresidentthendirectedPortertotellMcGahntocreatearecordtomake clear that the President never directed McGahnto fire the Special Counsel.’ Porter thoughtthe matter should be handled by the White House communicationsoffice, but the President said he wantedMcGahntowritealettertothefile“forourrecords”andwantedsomethingbeyondapress statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate.’”° The President referred to McGahn as a “lying bastard” andsaid that he wanted a record from him.”” Porter recalled the President sayingsomethingtotheeffectof,“Ifhedoesn’twritealetter,thenmaybeI'llhavetogetridof him.”

The next day, on February 6, 2018, Kelly scheduled time for McGahn to meet with him and the President in the Oval Office to discuss the Times article.8°’ The morning of the meeting, the President’s personal counsel called McGahn’sattorney and said that the President was going to be speaking with McGahn and McGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the meeting.*!°

The President began the Oval Office meeting bytelling McGahn that the New York Times story did not “look good” and McGahn neededto correctit.!' McGahnrecalled the President said, “I neversaid to fire Mueller. I never said ‘fire.’ This story doesn’t look good. You needto correct this. You’re the White House counsel.”*!?

In response, McGahn acknowledged that he had not told the President directly that he plannedto resign, butsaid that the story was otherwise accurate.*'? The President asked McGahn, “Did I say the word ‘fire’?”8'* McGahn responded, “What yousaid is, ‘Call Rod [Rosenstein], tellRodthatMuellerhasconflictsandcan’tbetheSpecialCounsel.’”*'® ThePresidentresponded, “I never said that.’8'® The President said he merely wanted McGahntoraise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein andleaveit to him to decide whatto do.*!7 McGahntoldthe President he did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, “Call Rod.

After the Oval Office meeting concluded, Kelly recalled McGahntelling him that McGahn and the President “did have that conversation” about removing the Special Counsel.” McGahn recalled that Kelly said that he had pointed outto the President after the Oval Office that McGahn had not backed down and would not budge.®”8 Following the Oval Office meeting, the President’s personal counsel called McGahn’s counsel and relayed that the President was “fine” with McGahn.*”?

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s efforts to have McGahndeny that he had been ordered to have theSpecialCounselremoved,thefollowingevidenceisrelevanttotheelementsofobstructionof
justice:

a. Obstructive act. The President’s repeated efforts to get McGahn tocreate a record denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an obstructive act ifit had the natural tendency to constrain McGahnfrom testifying truthfully or to underminehis credibility as a potential witnessif he testified consistently with his memory, rather than with what the record said.

There is some evidencethat at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories werepublishedin late January 2018, the Presidentbelieved the stories were wrong andthat he had never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The President correctly understood that McGahnhadnottold the President directly that he plannedto resign. In addition, the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and
in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn,the Presidentsaid, “I never said to fire Mueller. I never said ‘fire.”” That evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade McGahnto changehis story but wasinstead offering his own—but different—recollection ofthe substanceofhisJune2017conversationswithMcGahnandMcGahn’sreactiontothem.

Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President’s conduct. As previously described, see VolumeII, Section ILE, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn’s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed,includingthe timing and context of the President’s directive; the manner in which McGahnreacted; and the fact that the President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department of Justice, and should be raised with the President’s personal counsel rather than broughtto McGahn. In addition, the President’s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. Whenfirst asked about the New York Times story, the President said, “Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Timesfakestory.” And when the President spoke with McGahnin the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had used the word“fire,” saying, “I never said to fire Mueller. I never said ‘fire’” and “Did I say the word ‘fire’?” The President’s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahnto havethe Special Counsel removed thus runs counterto the evidence.

In addition, even ifthe President sincerely disagreed with McGahn’s memory ofthe June 17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the Oval Office
meeting that McGahn’s accountdiffered and that McGahn wasfirm in his views. Shortly after the story broke, the President’s counsel told McGahn’s counselthat the President wanted McGahnto make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded through his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply with the President’s request. .The President then directed Sandersto tell McGahnto correct the story, but McGahntold her he would not do so becausethe story was accurate in reporting on the President’s order. Consistent with that position, McGahnneverissued a correction. More than a week later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made commentsindicating the President thought McGahn had leaked the story, and directed Porter to have McGahncreate a record denying that the Presidenthadtriedto fire the Special Counsel. Atthat point, the President said he might “haveto get rid of’ McGahn ifMcGahndid not comply. McGahn againrefused and told Porter, as he had told Sanders andas his counsel hadtold the President’s counsel, that the President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. That evidence indicatesthatbythetimeoftheOvalOfficemeetingthePresidentwasawarethatMcGahndidnot think the story was false and did not want to issue a statementor create a written record denying facts that McGahnbelieved to be true. The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahnto repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. By January 2018, the Special Counsel’s use of a grand jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also was aware that the Special Counsel wasinvestigating obstruction-related events because, among other reasons, on January 8, 2018, the Special Counsel’s Office provided his counsel with a detailed list of topics for a possible interview with the President.° The President knew that McGahnhad personal knowledgeof manyofthe events the Special Counsel wasinvestigating and that McGahn hadalready beeninterviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval Office meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel’s Office about the President’s effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged McGahn for disclosing that information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating unnecessary legal exposure. That evidence indicates the President’s awarenessthat the June 17, 2017 events were relevantto the Special Counsel’s investigation and any grandjury investigation that might grow outofit.

Toestablish a nexus, it would be necessary to showthat the President’s actions would have the natural tendencyto affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or prevent the communication ofinformation to investigators. Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel investigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seekingto influencehis prior statements in those interviews. But because McGahnhadrepeatedly spoken to investigators and the obstruction inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would beinterviewed again on obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking to have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further investigative interviews would not be shown. Butthe President’s efforts to have McGahnwrite a letter“forourrecords”approximatelytendaysafterthestorieshadcomeout—wellpastthetypical time to issue a correction for a news story—indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings arising from it.

©; Intent. Substantial evidenceindicates that in repeatedly urging McGahnto dispute that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn’s accountin order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President’s conduct towards the investigation.

inquiry.
Several facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated attempts to get McGahnto changehis story. As described above, by the time ofthe last attempt, the evidence suggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahnbelieved the President had ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated. McGahninterpreted his encounter with the Presidentin the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he wasto his memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing McGahnto alter his accountbytelling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahnif he did not deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the President’s intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the prospectofthePresident’smeetingwithMcGahnthathecalledMcGahn’scounselandsaidthat McGahncould notresign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day. The President’s counsel was well aware of McGahn’s resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account ofeventsdespitethePresident’srequest. Finally,asnotedabove,thePresidentbroughtupthe Special Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahnandcriticized him for telling this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President’s statements reflect his understanding—andhis displeasure—that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice

Evidence

\subsubsection{Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn}

Aspreviously noted, see VolumeII, Section II.B, supra, the President asked for Flynn’s resignation on February 13, 2017. Following Flynn’sresignation, the President made positive public commentsabout Flynn, describing him as a “wonderful man,”“a fine person,” and a “very good person.”*?! ThePresidentalso privately asked advisors to pass messages to Flynn conveying that the Presidentstill cared about him and encouraging him to stay strong.*?

InlateNovember2017,FlynnbegantocooperatewiththisOffice. OnNovember22,2017, FlynnwithdrewfromajointdefenseagreementhehadwiththePresident.*°? Flynn’scounseltold the President’s personal counsel and counselfor the White Housethat Flynn could no longer have confidential communications with the White House or the President.83* Later that night, the President’s personal counselleft a voicemail for Flynn’s counsel that said:

I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms. ... [I]t wouldn’t surprise me ifyou’ve gone on to make a deal with... the government.... [I]f ... there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue, ... so,youknow, ... weneedsomekindofheadsup. Um,justforthesakeof protecting all our interests ifwe can. ... [R]emember what we’vealwayssaid about the
President andhis feelings toward Flynn and,thatstill remains ... 8°

On November23, 2017, Flynn’s attorneys returned the call from the President’s personal counsel to acknowledgereceipt of the voicemail.5*° Flynn’s attorneysreiterated that they were no longer in a position to share information under any sort of privilege.*°’ According to Flynn’s attorneys, the President’s personal counsel was indignant and vocal in his disagreement.* The President’spersonalcounselsaidthatheinterpretedwhattheysaidtohimasareflectionofFlynn’s hostilitytowardsthePresidentandthatheplannedtoinformhisclientofthatinterpretation.*? Flynn’s attorneys understoodthat statementto be an attempt to make them reconsidertheir position because the President’s personal counsel believed that Flynn would be disturbed to know that such a message would be conveyedto the President.*°

On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements pursuant to a cooperationagreement.**! Thenextday,thePresidenttoldthepressthathewasnotconcerned about what Flynn mighttell the Special Counsel.*? In response to a question about whetherthe Presidentstill stood behind Flynn, the President responded, “We’ll see what happens.”*Over the next several days, the President made public statements expressing sympathy for Flynn and indicating he had not beentreated fairly.““* On December 15, 2017, the President responded to a press inquiry about whether he wasconsidering a pardon for Flynn by saying,“I don’t wanttotall about pardons for Michael Flynn yet. We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very, very

\subsubsection{Conduct Directed at Paul Manafort}

OnOctober27,2017,agrandjuryintheDistrictofColumbiaindictedManafortandformer deputy campaign manager Richard Gates on multiple felony counts, and on February 22, 2018, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia indicted Manafort and Gates on additional felony counts.*46 The charges in both cases alleged criminal conduct by Manafort that began as early as 2005 and continued through 2018.84”

In January 2018, Manafort told Gates that he had talked to the President’s personal counsel andtheywere“goingtotakecareofus.”*4* ManaforttoldGatesitwasstupidtoplead,sayingthat he hadbeen in touch with the President’s personal counsel andrepeating that they should “sit tight” and “we’ll be taken care of.’*4? Gates asked Manafort outright ifanyone mentioned pardons and Manafort said no one used that word.

Asthe proceedings against Manafort progressed in court, the President told Porter that he neverliked Manafort and that Manafort did not know whathe wasdoing on the campaign.®*! The President discussed with aides whether and in what way Manafort might be cooperating with the Special Counsel’s investigation, and whether Manafort knew any information that would be harmful to the President.*>?

In public, the President made statements criticizing the prosecution and suggesting that Manafort wasbeing treated unfairly. On June 15, 2018, before a scheduled court hearing that day on whether Manafort’s bail should be revoked based on new charges that Manafort had tampered with witnesses while out on bail, the President told the press, “I feel badly about a lot of them because I think a lot ofit is very unfair. I mean, I look at some of them where they go back 12 years. Like Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign. But I feel so—Itell you,I feel little badly about it. They went back 12 yearsto get things that he did 12 years ago? ... I feel badly for some people, because they’ve gone back 12 yearsto find things about somebody, and I don’t think it’s right.”8°? In response to a question about whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort or other individuals involved in the Special Counsel’s investigation, the Presidentsaid, “T don’t wantto talk about that. No, I don’t wantto talk about that. ... But look, I do want to see peopletreated fairly. That’s whatit’s all about.” *°* Hourslater, Manafort’s bail was revoked and the President tweeted, “Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn’t know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all the others? Very unfair!””®°>

Immediately following the revocation of Manafort’s bail, the President’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, gave a series of interviews in which heraised the possibility of a pardon for Manafort. Giuliani told the New York Daily Newsthat “[w]hen the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with somepresidential pardons.”®°° Giulianialso said in an interview that, although the President should not pardon anyone while the Special Counsel’s investigation was ongoing, “when the investigation is concluded, he’s kind of on his own, right?”*? In a CNN interview two dayslater, Giuliani said, “T guess I should clarify this once and for all.... The president has issued no pardonsin this investigation. The president is not going to issue pardons inthisinvestigation....Whenit’sover,hey,he’sthepresidentoftheUnitedStates. Heretains his pardon power. Nobodyis taking that away from him.”*°* Giuliani rejected the suggestion that his and the President’s comments could signal to defendants that they should not cooperate in a criminal prosecution because a pardon might follow, saying the comments were “certainly not intendedthatway.”®°? Giulianisaidthecommentsonlyacknowledgedthatanindividualinvolved intheinvestigationwouldnotbe“excludedfrom[apardon],ifinfactthepresidentandhisadvisors
cometotheconclusionthatyouhavebeentreatedunfairly.”*°° Giulianiobservedthatpardons
.
were not unusualin political investigations but said, “That doesn’t mean they’re going to happen here. Doesn’t mean that anybody should rely on it. . . . Big signal is, nobody has been pardoned yet.86!

On July 31, 2018, Manafort’s criminal trial began in the Eastern District of Virginia, generating substantial news coverage.*The next day, the President tweeted, “This is a terrible situationandAttorneyGeneralJeffSessionsshouldstopthisRiggedWitchHuntrightnow,before it continuesto stain our country any further. Bob Muelleris totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!”*? Minuteslater, the President tweeted, “Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respectedpolitical leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn’t government tell me that he was underinvestigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion—a Hoax!”8* Later in the day, the President tweeted, “Looking back on history, who wastreated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and ‘Public Enemy Number One,’ or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement—although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?”*° The President’s tweets about the Manafort trial were widely covered by the press.*° When asked about the President’s tweets, Sanders told the press, “Certainly, the President’s been clear. He thinks Paul Manafort’s been treated unfairly.”®%

On August16, 2018, the Manafort case was submitted to the jury and deliberations began. Atthat time, Giuliani had recently suggested to reporters that the Special Counselinvestigation neededto be “donein the next two or three weeks,”8°* and mediastories reported that a Manafort acquittal would addto criticism that the Special Counselinvestigation was not worththe time and expense, whereasa conviction could show that ending the investigation would be premature.®?

On August 17, 2018, as jury deliberations continued, the President commented on thetrial from the South Lawn of the White House. In an impromptu exchange with reporters that lasted approximately five minutes, the President twice called the Special Counsel’s investigation a “rigged witch hunt.”*”° When asked whether he would pardon Manafort ifhe was convicted, the President said, “I don’t talk about that now. I don’t talk about that.”®7! The President then added, without being asked a further question,“I think the whole Manaforttrial is very sad when you look at what’s going on there. I thinkit’s a very sad day for our country. He worked for me for a very short period of time. But you know what, he happens to be a very good person. AndI thinkit’s very sad whatthey’ve done to Paul Manafort.”*”? The President did nottake further questions.” In response to the President’s statements, Manafort’s attorney said, “Mr. Manafort really appreciates the support of President Trump.”®”

On August 21, 2018, the jury found Manafort guilty on eight felony counts. Also on August 21, Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight offenses, including a campaign-finance violation that he said had occurred “in coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office.”8”> The President reacted to Manafort’s convictions that day bytelling reporters, “Paul Manafort’s a good man” and “it’s a very sad thing that happened.”*”* The President described the Special Counsel’s investigation as “a witch hunt that ends in disgrace.”®”” The next day,thePresidenttweeted,“IfeelverybadlyforPaulManafortandhiswonderfulfamily. ‘Justice’ took a 12 year old tax case, among otherthings, applied tremendouspressure on him and, unlike MichaelCohen,herefusedto‘break’—makeupstoriesinordertogeta‘deal.’ Suchrespectfor a brave man!”878

In a Fox Newsinterview on August 22, 2018, the President said: “[Cohen] makesa better deal when he uses me, like everybody else. And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so muchis he went through thattrial—you know they makeupstories. People make up stories. This whole thing aboutflipping, they call it, I know all about flipping.”*”? The President said that flipping was “not fair” and “almost ought to be outlawed.”*®° In response to a question about whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the Presidentsaid, “I have great respect for whathe’s done, in terms ofwhat he’s gone through. ... He worked for many, many people many, many years, and I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.”**! Giuliani told journalists that the President “really thinks Manafort has been horribly treated” and that he and the President had discussed the political fallout if the President pardoned Manafort.*** The next day, Giuliani told the Washington Post that the President had asked his lawyers for advice on the possibility of a pardon for Manafort and otheraides, and had been counseled against considering a pardon until the investigation concluded.**

On September 14, 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty to charges in the District of Columbia and signed a plea agreementthat required him to cooperate with investigators.“ Giuliani was reported to have publicly said that Manafort remained in a joint defense agreement with the President following Manafort’s guilty plea and agreement to cooperate, and that Manafort’s attorneys regularly briefed the President’s lawyers on the topics discussed and the information ManaforthadprovidedininterviewswiththeSpecialCounsel’sOffice.*®° OnNovember26,2018, the Special Counsel’s Office disclosed in a public court filing that Manafort had breachedhis plea agreementby lying about multiple subjects.**° The next day, Giuliani said that the President had been “upset for weeks” about what he considered to be “the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.”®8” In an interview on November 28, 2018, the President suggested that it was “very brave” that Manafort did not “flip”:

Ifyoutoldthetruth,yougotojail. Youknowthisflippingstuffisterrible. Youflipand youlieandyouget—theprosecutorswilltellyou99percentofthetimetheycangetpeople to flip. It’s rare that they can’t. But I had three people: Manafort, Corsi—l don’t know

In response to a question abouta potential pardon for Manafort, the Presidentsaid, “It was never discussed,butIwouldn’ttakeitoffthetable. WhywouldItakeitoffthetable?”*”°

Analysis

InanalyzingthePresident’sconducttowardsFlynn,Manafort,Roa.thefollowing evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction ofjustice:

Obstructive act. The President’s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel’s investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to preventparticular witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing, delaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement.

With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him before he began to cooperate with the government. When Flynn’s attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially cooperating with the government, the President’s personal counselinitially reminded Flynn’s counsel ofthe President’s warm feelings towards Flynn andsaid “thatstill remains.” But when Flynn’s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the President’s personal counsel stated that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn’s hostility towards the President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn’s decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President waspersonally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn’s counsel.

With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President’s actions had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government. The President andhis personalcounsel made repeatedstatements suggesting that a pardon wasa possibility for Manafort, while also makingit clear that the President did not want Manafort to “flip” and cooperate with the government. On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort’s D.C. case was considering whether to revokehisbail, the President said that he “felt badly” for Manafort and stated, “I think a lot ofit is very unfair.” And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the President said, “I do want to see people treated fairly. That’s whatit’s all about.” Later that day, after Manafort’s bail was revoked, the President called it a “tough sentence” that was “Very unfair!” Two dayslater, the President’s personal counselstated that individuals involved in the Special Counsel’s investigation could receive a pardon“if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors ... come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly”’—using language that paralleled how the President had already described the treatment of Manafort. Those statements, combined withthePresident’scommendationofManafortforbeinga“braveman”who“refusedto“break’,” suggested that a pardon was a morelikely possibility ifManafort continued not to cooperate with the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, he was foundto have violated the agreementbylying to investigators.

The President’s public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second dayoftrial, for example,the President called the prosecution a “terrible situation” and a “hoax”that “continues to stain our country” and referred to Manafort as a “Reagan/Doledarling” who was“servingsolitary confinement” even though he was “convicted of nothing.” Those statements were widely picked up by the press. While jurors were instructed not to watch or read newsstories about the case and are presumed to follow those instructions, the President’s statements during the trial generated substantialmediacoveragethatcouldhavereachedjurorsiftheyhappenedtoseethestatements or learned about them from others. And the President’s statements during jury deliberations that Manafort “happensto be a very good person” andthat“it’s very sad what they’ve done to Paul Manafort”hadthepotentialtoinfluencejurorswholearnedofthestatements,whichthePresident madejust as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort.

Nexusto an official proceeding. The President’s actions towards Flynn, Manafort, appearto have been connected to pendingoranticipated official proceedings involving eachindividual. ThePresident’sconducttowardsFynLOL principallyoccurredwhenboth were undercriminal investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office and press reports speculated about whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel’s investigation. And the President’s conduct towards Manafort wasdirectly connectedto the official proceedings involving him. The President made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort’s criminal
trial. And the President’s comments about the prospect ofManafort “flipping” occurred whenit wasclear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings.

Intent. Evidence concerning the President’s intent related to Flynn as a potential witnessis inconclusive. As previously noted, becauseofprivilege issues we do not have evidence establishing whether the President knew aboutor wasinvolvedin his counsel’s communications with Flynn’s counselstating that Flynn’s decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement and cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting “hostility” towards the President. And regardless of whatthe President’s personal counsel communicated, the President continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, stating that Flynn had “led a very strong life” and the President “fe[It] very badly” about what had happenedto him.

Evidence concerning the President’s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before Manafort was convicted,thePresidentrepeatedlystatedthatManaforthadbeentreatedunfairly. Onedayafter Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges andpotentially faced a lengthy prison term, the PresidentsaidthatManafortwas“abraveman”forrefusingto“break”andthat“flipping”“almost oughtto be outlawed.” At the sametime, although the President had privately told aides he did not like Manafort, he publicly called Manafort “a good man”andsaid he had a “wonderfulfamily.” And when the President was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the President did not respond directly and instead said he had “great respect for what [Manafort]’s done,intermsofwhathe’sgonethrough.” ThePresidentaddedthat“someofthechargesthey threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.” In light of the President’s counsel’s previous statements that the investigations “might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons” and that a pardon would be possible if the President “come[s] to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly,” the evidence supports the inference that the President intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon, which would make cooperation with the government as a meansofobtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.

Wealso examined the evidenceofthe President’s intent in making public statements about Manafortatthebeginningofhistrialandwhenthejurywasdeliberating. Someevidencesupports a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury. Thetrial generated widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal would add to pressure to end the Special Counsel’s investigation. By publicly stating on the second day ofdeliberations that Manafort “happens to be a very good person”andthat“it’s very sad what they’ve done to Paul Manafort” right after calling the Special Counsel’s investigation a “rigged witch hunt,” the President’s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a factfinder could infer that the President intendedthat result. But there are alternative explanations for the President’s comments, including that he genuinely felt sorry for Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to influence public opinion. The President’s comments also could have been intended to continue sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above, the President made his comments about Manafort being “a very good person” immediately after declining to answera question about whether he would pardon Manafort.

\subsection{The President’s Conduct Involving Michael Cohen}

Overview

The President’s conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our investigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscowproject on behalf of the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trumpshould travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the media began questioning Trump’s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a “party line” that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its Russia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the President’s connections to Russia, Cohen submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower Moscowprojectthree times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen had notreceived a responseto an outreach he madeto the Russian government,andthat the project ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President’s personal counsel, who,according to Cohen,said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the statement short and “tight.” After the FBI searched Cohen’s home andoffice in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not “flip” and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President’s personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do “something else” to make
the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the governmentin July 2018,the President publicly criticized him, called him a “rat,” and suggested his family members had committed crimes.

Evidence

\subsubsection{Candidate Trump’s Awareness of and Involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow Project}

The President’s interactions with Cohen as a witness took place against the background of the President’s involvementin the Trump Tower Moscow project.

Asdescribed in detail in VolumeI, Section IV.A.1, supra, from September 2015 until at least June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower Moscowproject in Russia, with negotiations conducted by Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.%?
The Trump Organization had previously and unsuccessfully pursued a building project in Moscow.”!° According to Cohen,in approximately September 2015 he obtained internal approval from Trump to negotiate on behalf of the Trump Organization to have a Russian corporation build a tower in Moscowthatlicensed the Trump name andbrand.°'! CohenthereafterhadnumerousbriefconversationswithTrumpabouttheproject.?”? CohenrecalledthatTrumpwantedtobeupdatedonanydevelopmentswithTrumpTowerMoscow and on several occasions brought the project up with Cohen to ask what was happening onit." Cohen also discussed the project on multiple occasions with Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.?!4

In the fall of 2015, Trump signed a Letter of Intent for the project that specified highly lucrative terms for the Trump Organization.?'> In December 2015, Felix Sater, who was handling negotiations between Cohen and the Russian corporation, asked Cohen for a copy of his and Trump’s passports to facilitate travel to Russia to meet with governmentofficials and possible financing partners.?'© Cohen recalled discussing the trip with Trump and requesting a copy of Trump’s passport from Trump’spersonal secretary, Rhona Graff?!”

By January 2016, Cohen had becomefrustrated that Sater had not set up a meeting with Russian government officials, so Cohen reached out directly by email to the office of Dmitry Peskov,whowasPutin’sdeputychiefofstaffandpresssecretary.°'* OnJanuary20,2016,Cohen received an email response from Elena Poliakova, Peskov’s personalassistant, and phonerecords confirm that they then spoke for approximately twenty minutes, during which Cohendescribed the Trump Tower Moscowproject and requested assistance in movingthe project forward.?!? Cohen recalled briefing candidate Trump aboutthe call soon afterwards.°”° Cohen told Trump he spoke withawomanheidentifiedas“someonefromtheKremlin,”andCohenreportedthatshewasvery professionalandaskeddetailedquestionsabouttheproject."' CohenrecalledtellingTrumphe wished the Trump Organization had assistants who were as competent as the woman from the Kremlin?”

Cohenthoughthisphonecallrenewedinterestintheproject.“ ThedayafterCohen’scall with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him to “[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat ...It’saboutPutintheycalledtoday.”°* SatertoldCohenthattheRussiangovernmentlikedthe project and on January 25, 2016, sent an invitation for Cohen to visit Moscow “for a working visit.”°2> After the outreach from Sater, Cohenrecalledtelling Trumpthat he was waiting to hear back on moving the project forward.”

AfterJanuary2016,CohencontinuedtohaveconversationswithSateraboutTrumpTower Moscow and continued to keep candidate Trump updated about those discussions and thestatus oftheproject.°?” CohenrecalledthatheandTrumpwantedTrumpTowerMoscowtosucceedand that Trump never discouraged him from working on the project because of the campaign.?* In March or April 2016, Trump asked Cohen if anything was happening in Russia.” Cohen also recalled briefing Donald TrumpJr. in the spring—a conversation that Cohen said was not “idle chit chat” because Trump Tower Moscow waspotentially a \$1 billion deal.”°

Cohen recalled that around May 2016, he again raised with candidate Trumpthepossibility ofatriptoRussiatoadvancetheTrumpTowerMoscowproject.”*' Atthattime,Cohenhad receivedseveraltextsfromSaterseekingtoarrangedatesforsuchatrip.”OnMay4,2016,Sater wrote to Cohen, “I had a chat with Moscow. ASSUMINGthetrip does happen the question is beforeoraftertheconvention.....Obviouslythepremeetingtrip(youonly)canhappenanytime you want but the 2 big guys[is] the question. I said I would confirm and revert.”’*? Cohen responded, “My trip before Cleveland. Trump once he becomes the nominee after the convention.”**4 On May 5, 2016, Sater followed up with a text that Cohen thought he probably read to Trump:

Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum whichis Russia’s Davosit’s June 16-19. He wants to meet there with you and possibly introduceyouto either Putin or Medvedev. ... This is perfect. The entire business classofRussiawillbethereaswell. Hesaidanythingyouwanttodiscussincluding dates and subjects are on the table to discuss.”

Cohen recalled discussing the invitation to the St. Petersburg Economic Forum with candidate Trump and saying that Putin or Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev might be there.CohenrememberedthatTrumpsaidthathewouldbewillingtotraveltoRussiaifCohen could “lock and load” on the deal.’ In June 2016, Cohen decided not to attend the St. Petersburg Economic Forum because Sater had not obtained a formalinvitation for Cohen from Peskov.?** Cohensaid he had a quick conversation with Trumpatthat time butdid nottell him that the project was over because he did not want Trump to complain that the deal was on-again-off-again ifit were revived.”

During the summer of 2016, Cohenrecalled that candidate Trump publicly claimedthat he had nothing to do with Russia and then shortly afterwards privately checked with Cohen aboutthe status of the Trump Tower Moscowproject, which Cohen found “interesting.”°4° At some point that summer, Cohen recalled having a brief conversation with Trump in which Cohensaid the Trump Tower Moscow project was going nowhere because the Russian development company hadnotsecuredapieceofpropertyfortheproject.! Trumpsaidthatwas“toobad,”andCohen did notrecall talking with Trumpaboutthe project after that.” Cohensaid thatat no time during the campaign did Trump tell him not to pursue the project or that the project should be abandoned.”

\subsubsection{Cohen Determines to Adhere to a “Party Line” Distancing Candidate Trump From Russia}

Aspreviously discussed, see VolumeII, Section II.A, supra, when questions aboutpossible Russian support for candidate Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump denied having any personal, financial, or business connection to Russia, which Cohen described as the “party line”or “message”to follow for Trump andhis senior advisors.*"

After the election, the Trump Organization sought to formally close out certain deals in advanceoftheinauguration.”4° CohenrecalledthatTrumpTowerMoscowwasonthelistofdeals to be closed out.“ In approximately January 2017, Cohen began receiving inquiries from the media about Trump Tower Moscow,and herecalled speaking to the President-Elect when those inquiries came in.*” Cohen was concernedthattruthful answers about the Trump Tower Moscow project might not be consistent with the “message” that the President-Elect had no relationship with Russia.“*

In an effort to “stay on message,” Cohen told a New York Times reporter that the Trump Tower Moscowdeal wasnotfeasible and had ended in January 2016.Cohenrecalled that this waspartofa“script”ortalkingpointshehaddevelopedwithPresident-ElectTrumpandothersto
dismiss the idea of a substantial connection between Trump and Russia.” Cohen said that he discussed the talking points with Trump butthat he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they wereuntruebecauseTrumpalreadyknewtheywereuntrue.”°! Cohenthoughtitwasimportantto say the deal was donein January 2016, rather than acknowledgethat talks continued in May and June 2016, because it limited the period when candidate Trump could be alleged to have a relationship with Russia to an early point in the campaign, before Trump had becomethe party’s presumptive nominee.’

\subsubsection{Cohen Submits False Statements to Congress Minimizing the Trump Tower Moscow Project in Accordance with the Party Line}

In early May 2017, Cohen received requests from Congress to provide testimony and documents in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election? At that time, Cohen understood Congress’s interest in him to be focused on the allegationsin the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russianofficials in Prague during the campaign.?* Cohen had nevertraveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.9°° On May 18, 2017, Cohen met with the President to discuss the request from Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that he should cooperate because there was nothing there.?>°

Cohen eventually entered into ajoint defense agreement (JDA)with the President and other individuals who were part of the Russia investigation.” In the months leading up to his congressionaltestimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President’s personal counsel.** Cohen said that in those conversations the President’s personal counsel would sometimes say that he had just been with the President.Cohen recalled that the President’s personal counseltold him the JDA was working well together and assured him that there was nothing there and ifthey stayed on messagetheinvestigationswouldcometoanendsoon.Atthattime,Cohen’slegalbillswere being paid by the Trump Organization,*®! and Cohen was told not to worry because the investigations would be over by summeror fall of 2017.Cohen said that the President’s personal counselalso conveyed that, as part ofthe JDA, Cohen wasprotected, which he would not be if he “went rogue.”* Cohenrecalled that the President’s personal counsel reminded him that “the President loves you”and told him that ifhe stayed on message, the President had his back.°TM

InAugust2017,CohenbegandraftingastatementaboutTrumpTowerMoscowtosubmit to Congress along with his document production.” The final version of the statementcontained several false statements aboutthe project.°First, although the Trump Organization continuedto pursue the project until at least June 2016, the statement said, “The proposal was under consideration at the Trump Organization from September 2015 until the end of January 2016. By the end of January 2016, I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business reasons and should not be pursued further. Based on my business determinations, the Trump Organization abandoned the proposal.”°6” Second, although Cohen and candidate Trump had discussed possible travel to Russia by Trumpto pursue the venture, the statementsaid, “Despite overturesbyMr.Sater,IneverconsideredaskingMr.TrumptotraveltoRussiainconnectionwith this proposal. I told Mr. Sater that Mr. Trump would not travel to Russia unless there was a definitive agreementin place.”*Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump onthestatus ofthe project and had numerous conversationsaboutit, the statement said, “Mr. Trump was never in contact with anyone about this proposal other than me on three occasions, including signing a non-bindingletter of intent in 2015.”Fourth, although Cohen’s outreach to Peskov in January 2016 had resulted in a lengthy phonecall with a representative from the Kremlin, the statement said that Cohen did “not recall any response to my email [to Peskov], nor any other contacts by me with Mr. Peskovor other Russian governmentofficials about the proposal.”°”°

Cohen’s statement was circulated in advance to, and edited by, members of the JDA.7”! Before the statement wasfinalized, early drafts contained a sentencestating, “The building project led me to makelimited contacts with Russian governmentofficials.”” In the final version ofthe statement, that line was deleted.””? Cohen thoughthe wastold that it was a decision ofthe JDA to take out that sentence, and he did not push back on the deletion.°’* Cohenrecalled that he told the President’spersonalcounselthathewouldnotcontestadecisionoftheJDA.””

Cohen also recalled that in drafting his statement for Congress, he spoke with the President’s personal counsel about a different issue that connected candidate Trump to Russia: Cohen’sefforts to set up a meeting between TrumpandPutin in New York during the 2015 United Nations General Assembly.?”° In September 2015, Cohen had suggested the meeting to Trump, who told Cohento reach out to Putin’s office aboutit.°”” Cohen spoke and emailed with a Russian official about a possible meeting, and recalled that Trump asked him multiple times for updates on the proposed meeting with Putin.°”® When Cohencalled the Russian official a second time, she told him it would not follow properprotocolfor Putin to meet with Trump, and Cohenrelayed that message to Trump.?”? Cohen anticipated he might be asked questions about the proposed Trump- Putin meeting when hetestified before Congress because he had talked about the potential meeting on Sean Hannity’s radio show.°®° Cohenrecalled explaining to the President’s personal counsel the “whole story” ofthe attempt to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin and Trump’srole init.°8! CohenrecalledthatheandthePresident’spersonalcounseltalkedaboutkeepingTrump out ofthe narrative, and the President’s personal counsel told Cohen the story wasnot relevant and should not be includedin his statement to Congress.?*

Cohen said that his “agenda” in submitting the statement to Congress with false representations about the Trump Tower Moscowproject was to minimizelinks betweenthe project and the President, give the false impression that the project had ended before the first presidential primaries, and shut downfurther inquiry into Trump Tower Moscow,with the aim oflimiting the ongoingRussiainvestigations.”*? CohensaidhewantedtoprotectthePresidentandbeloyalto him by not contradicting anything the President had said.?** Cohenrecalled he was concernedthat ifhe told the truth aboutgetting a response from the Kremlin or speaking to candidate Trump about travel to Russia to pursue the project, he would contradict the message that no connection existed between Trumpand Russia, and herationalized his decision to provide false testimony because the deal never happened.?® He was not concerned that the story would be contradicted by individualswhoknewitwasfalsebecausehewasstickingtothepartylineadheredtobythewhole group.°\%° Cohen wanted the support of the President and the White House, and he believed that following the party line would help put an end to the Special Counsel and congressional investigations.?*”

Between August 18, 2017, when the statement wasin aninitial draft stage, and August 28, 2017, when the statement was submitted to Congress, phone recordsreflect that Cohen spoke with the President’s personal counsel almost daily.?8* On August 27, 2017, the day before Cohen submitted the statement to Congress, Cohen and the President’s personal counsel had numerous contacts by phone,includingcalls lasting three, four, six, eleven, and eighteen minutes.8? Cohen recalled telling the President’s personal counsel, who did not havefirst-hand knowledge of the project, that there was more detail on Trump Tower Moscow that was not in the statement, including that there were more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the statement reflected.°” Cohen stated that the President’s personal counsel respondedthat it was not necessary to elaborate or include those details because the project did not progress and that Cohen should keep his statementshort and “tight” and the matter would soon come to an end.””! Cohen recalled that the President’s personal counsel said “his client” appreciated Cohen,that Cohen should stay on message and not contradict the President, that there wasnoneedtomuddythewater,andthatitwastimetomoveon.”? Cohensaidheagreedbecause itwaswhathewasexpectedtodo.AfterCohenlaterpleadedguiltytomakingfalsestatements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, this Office sought to speak with the President’s personal counsel about these conversations with Cohen, but counsel declined,citing potential privilege concerns.°*

At the same time that Cohen finalized his written submission to Congress, he served as a source for a Washington Post story published on August 27, 2017, that reported in depth for the first time that the Trump Organization was “pursuing a plan to develop a massive Trump Tower in Moscow”at the same time as candidate Trump was“runningfor president in late 2015 and early 2016.”° Thearticle reported that “the project was abandonedat the end ofJanuary 2016,just beforethepresidentialprimariesbegan,severalpeoplefamiliarwiththeproposalsaid.””°° Cohen recalled that in speaking to the Post, he held to the false story that negotiations for the deal ceased in January 2016.”

On August 28, 2017, Cohen submitted his statement about the Trump Tower Moscow projecttoCongress.”* CohendidnotrecalltalkingtothePresidentaboutthespecificsofwhat the statement said or what Cohen would later testify to about Trump Tower Moscow.” He recalled speaking to the President more generally about how he plannedto stay on message in his testimony.' On September 19, 2017, in anticipation of his impending testimony, Cohen orchestrated the public release of his opening remarks to Congress, whichcriticized the allegations in the Steele material and claimed that the Trump Tower Moscowproject “was terminated in January of 2016; which occurred before the Iowa caucus and months before the very first primary.”!°°!

\subsubsection{The President Sends Messages of Support to Cohen}

In January 2018, the media reported that Cohen had arranged a \$130,000 paymentduring the campaign to prevent a woman from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter she had with the Presidentbefore he ran for office.'°” This Office did not investigate Cohen’s campaign- period payments to women.'°? However, those events, as described here, are potentially relevant to the President’s and his personal counsel’s interactions with Cohen as a witness wholater began to cooperate with the government.

On February 13, 2018, Cohen released a statement to news organizations that stated, “In a
private transaction in 2016, I used my own personalfundsto facilitate a payment of \$130,000 to
[the woman]. Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the
May-Contain-
transaction with [the woman], and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or
indirectly.”IncongressionaltestimonyonFebruary27,2019,Cohentestifiedthathehad
discussed what to say about the payment with the President and that the President had directed
Cohen to say that the President “was not knowledgeable . . . of [Cohen’s] actions” in making the
payment.'°!© Qn February 19, 2018, the day after the New York Times wrote a detailed story
attributing the payment to Cohen and describing Cohenas the President’s “fixer,” Cohen received
a text message from the President’s personal counsel that stated, “Client says thanks for what you do.7!0l!

On April 9, 2018, FBI agents working with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District ofNew York executed search warrants on Cohen’s home,hotel room, and office.'°'? That day,thePresidentspoketoreportersandsaidthathehad“justheardthattheybrokeintotheoffice of one of my personal attorneys—a good man.”'°'3 The President called the searches “a real disgrace” andsaid, “It’s an attack on our country, in a true sense. It’s an attack on what weall stand for.”!°'* Cohen said that after the searches he was concerned that he was “an open book,” that he did not want issues arising from the payments to womento “comeout,” and that his false statements to Congress were ‘‘a big concern.”!°!°

A few daysafter the searches, the President called Cohen.'"! According to Cohen, the President said he wanted to “checkin” and askedif Cohen wasokay,andthe President encouraged Cohen to “hangin there”and“stay strong.”!°'? Cohen also recalled that following the searches he heard from individuals who werein touch with the President and relayed to Cohen the President’s
a.
supportforhim.'°!* Cohenrecalledthat
to say that he was with “the Boss” in Mar-a-Lago and the President had said “he loves you” and not to worry.'°!? Cohenrecalled that for the Trump Organization,told him,“the boss loves you.” , a friend of the President’s, told him, “everyone knowsthe boss has your back.”

On orabout April 17, 2018, Cohen began speaking with an attorney, Robert Costello, who had a close relationship with Rudolph Giuliani, one of the President’s personal lawyers.idee Costello told Cohenthat he had a “back channel ofcommunication” to Giuliani, and that Giuliani hadsaidthe“channel”was“crucial”and“mustbemaintained.”!°OnApril20,2018,theNew York Timespublished anarticle aboutthe President’s relationship with and treatment ofCohen.'TM The President responded with a series of tweets predicting that Cohen would not“flip”:

The New York Times anda third rate reporter . . . are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohenandhis relationship with mein the hope thathe will ‘flip.’ They use non- existent ‘sources’ and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michaelis a businessmanfor his own account/lawyer whoI have always liked&respected. MostpeoplewillflipiftheGovernmentletsthemoutoftrouble,even if it means lying or making upstories. Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Huntandthe dishonest media!!©%

In an email that day to Cohen, Costello wrote that he had spoken with Giuliani.'© Costello told Cohenthe conversation was “Very Very Positive[.] You are ‘loved’. . . they are in our corner. .. . Sleep well tonight[], you have friends in high places.”!°77

Cohen said that following these messages he believed he had the support of the White Houseif he continued to toe the party line, and he determinedto stay on messageand bepart of the team.!°28 At the time, Cohen’s understoodthat his legal fees werestill being paid by the Trump Organization,whichhesaidwasimportanttohim.'°? Cohenbelievedheneededthepowerofthe Presidenttotakecareofhim,soheneededtodefendthePresidentandstayonmessage.'©°

Cohenalso recalled speaking with the President’s personal counsel about pardonsafter the searches of his home andoffice had occurred, at a time when the media had reported that pardon discussionswereoccurringattheWhiteHouse.'°3! CohentoldthePresident’spersonalcounsel he had been a loyal lawyer and servant, and he said that after the searches he was in an uncomfortable position and wanted to know what wasin it for him.'%?
According to Cohen, the President’s personal counsel responded that Cohen should stay on message, that the investigation was a witch hunt, and that everything would be fine.'? Cohen understood based on this conversation and previous conversations about pardonswith the President’s personal counsel that as long as he stayed on message, he would be taken care of by the President, either through a pardonorthrough the investigation being shut down.'°*

On April 24, 2018, the President responded to a reporter’s inquiry whether he would consider a pardon for Cohen with, “Stupid question.”'> On June 8, 2018, the President said he “hadn’t even thought about” pardons for Manafort or Cohen, and continued,“It’s far too early to be thinking about that. They haven’t been convicted of anything. There’s nothing to pardon.”!°*° And on June 15, 2018, the President expressed sympathy for Cohen, Manafort, and Flynn in a press interview and said, “I feel badly about a lot of them, because I think lot ofit is very unfair.”!37

\subsubsection{The President’s Conduct After Cohen Began Cooperating with the Government}

OnJuly 2, 2018, ABC Newsreported based on an “exclusive” interview with Cohen that Cohen “strongly signaled his willingness to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller and federalprosecutorsintheSouthernDistrictofNewYork—evenifthatputsPresidentTrumpin
jeopardy.”'°35Thatweek,themediareportedthatCohenhadaddedanattorneytohislegalteam whopreviously had workedasa legal advisor to President Bill Clinton.'°°

Beginning on July 20, 2018, the media reported on the existence of a recording Cohen had made of a conversation he had with candidate Trump about a payment made to a second woman who said she had had an affair with Trump.'°4? On July 21, 2018, the President responded: “Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning}— almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client—totally unheard of & perhapsillegal. The good newsis that your favorite President did nothing wrong!”""' On July 27, 2018, after the media reported that Cohen waswilling to inform investigators that Donald TrumpJr.told his father about the June 9, 2016 meeting to get “dirt” on Hillary Clinton,'the President tweeted: “[S]o the Fake News doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions, NO,I did NOTknowofthemeetingwithmyson,Donjr. Soundstomelikesomeoneistryingtomakeup stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee, I wonderif they helped him makethe choice!”

On September 17, 2018, this Office submitted written questions to the President that included questions about the Trump Tower Moscow project and attached Cohen’s written statementtoCongressandtheLetterofIntentsignedbythePresident.'°*’ Amongotherissues, the questions asked the President to describe the timing and substance ofdiscussions he had with Cohen about the project, whether they discussed a potential trip to Russia, and whether the President“at any time direct[ed] or suggest[ed] that discussions about the Trump Moscowproject should cease,” or whether the President was “informed at any time that the project had been abandoned.”!%48

On November20, 2018,the President submitted written responses that did not answer those questions about Trump Tower Moscowdirectly and did not provide any information about the timingofthecandidate’sdiscussionswithCohenabouttheprojectorwhetherheparticipatedin any discussions about the project being abandoned or no longer pursued.'*? Instead, the President’s answers stated in relevantpart:

I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. AsI recall, they were brief, and they were not memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do notrecall any discussionoftraveltoRussiainconnectionwithit. Idonotrememberdiscussingitwith anyoneelse at the Trump Organization, although it is possible. I do not recall being aware at the time of any communications between Mr. Cohen and Felix Sater and any Russian governmentofficial regarding the Letter of Intent.!°

On November 29, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress basedonhisstatementsabouttheTrumpTowerMoscowproject.'®!' Inapleaagreementwiththis Office, Cohen agreed to “provide truthful information regarding any and all matters as to which this Office deems relevant.”!°** Later on November29, after Cohen’s guilty plea had become public, the President spoke to reporters about the Trump Tower Moscowproject, saying:

In light of the President’s public statements following Cohen’s guilty plea that he “decided not to do the project,” this Office again sought information from the President about whether he participated in any discussions about the project being abandonedor no longer pursued, including whenhe“decidednottodotheproject,”whohespoketoaboutthatdecision,andwhatmotivated
the decision.'°’ The Office also again asked for the timing of the President’s discussions with Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow andasked him to specify “what period ofthe campaign” he was involved in discussions concerning the project.'8 In response, the President’s personal counsel declined to provide additional information from the Presidentandstated that “the President has fully answered the questionsat issue.”!°°?

In the weeks following Cohen’s plea and agreement to provide assistance to this Office, the President repeatedly implied that Cohen’s family members were guilty of crimes. On December 3, 2018, after Cohen had filed his sentencing memorandum, the President tweeted, ““Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time.’ You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term? He makesupstories to get a GREAT & ALREADYreduced dealfor himself, and get his wife andfather-in-law (who has the money?) offScott Free.

On December 16, 2018, the President tweeted, “Remember, Michael Cohen only becamea ‘Rat’ after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable \& unheard ofuntil the Witch Hunt wasillegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE! Whydidn’t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked’s office?”!°TM

In January 2019, after the media reported that Cohen would provide public testimony ina congressional hearing, the President made additional public comments suggesting that Cohen’s family members had committed crimes. In an interview on Fox on January 12, 2019, the President was asked whether he was worried about Cohen’stestimony and responded:

[{]n order to get his sentence reduced, [Cohen] says “I have anidea,I'll ah, tell—I’Il give yousomeinformationonthepresident.” Well,thereisnoinformation.

On January 18, 2019, the President tweeted, “Kevin Corke, @FoxNews ‘Don’t forget, Michael Cohen hasalready been convicted ofperjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he mayhavestolen tens ofthousandsofdollars. . . .”- Lying toreducehisjailtime!

Also in January 2019, Giuliani gave press interviews that appeared to confirm Cohen’s accountthat the Trump Organization pursued the Trump Tower Moscowproject well past January 2016. Giuliani stated that “it’s our understanding that [discussions about the Trump Moscow project] went on throughout 2016. Weren’t a lot of them, but there were conversations.

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s conduct related to Cohen, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction ofjustice.

Obstructiveact. WegatheredevidenceofthePresident’sconductrelatedtoCohen on two issues:(i) whether the Presidentor others aided or participated in Cohen’sfalse statements to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government.

First, with regard to Cohen’s false statements to Congress, while there is evidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscowproject, the evidence available to us does not establish that the President directed or aided Cohen’sfalse testimony.

Cohensaid that his statements to Congress followed a “party line” that developed within the campaignto align with the President’s public statements distancing the President from Russia. Cohenalsorecalled that, in speaking with the President in advanceoftestifying, he madeit clear that he would stay on message—which Cohen believed they both understood would require false testimony. But Cohen said that he and the Presidentdid not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or wasfalse, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohenalso said he did nottell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony. During the time whenhis statement to Congress was being drafted and circulated to members ofthe JDA, Cohendid not speak directly to the President about the statement, but rather communicated with the President’s personal counsel—as corroborated by phone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President’s personal counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and whenhetestified before Congress.

Cohenrecalled that in his discussions with the President’s personal counsel on August 27, 2017—the day before Cohen’s statement was submitted to Congress—Cohensaid that there were more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concernatthat time. According to Cohen, the President’s personal counsel—who did not have first-hand knowledge of the project— responded by sayingthat there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include those details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short andtight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President. Cohen’s recollection of the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen’s draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA. For example, Cohen omitted any reference to his outreach to Russian governmentofficials to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohenbelieved it was a decision of theJDAtodeletethesentence,“ThebuildingprojectledmetomakelimitedcontactswithRussian governmentofficials.”

The President’s personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the President wasawareoftheinformationCohenprovidedtothePresident’spersonalcounsel. ThePresident’s conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-clientprivilege, and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications. The absence of evidence about the President and his counsel’s conversations about the drafting of Cohen’s statement precludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played.

Second, we considered whether the President tookactions that would have the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal investigators or to Congress.

Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately urged Cohento stay on message and not “flip.” Cohen recalled the President’s personal counsel telling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go “rogue.” In the days and weeks thatfollowedtheApril2018searchesofCohen’shomeandoffice,thePresidenttoldreportersthat Cohenwasa “good man”andsaid he was“a fine person with a wonderful family ... who I have always liked & respected.” Privately, the President told Cohen to “hang in there” and “stay strong.” People who wereclose to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohenthat “the President loves you,”“the boss loves you,” and “everyone knowsthe boss has your back.” Throughthe President’s personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen “thanks for what you do” after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to womenthat, according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew wasfalse. At that time, the Trump Organization continued to pay Cohen’s legal fees, which was important to Cohen. Cohenalso recalleddiscussingthepossibilityofapardonwiththePresident’spersonalcounsel,whotoldhim tostayonmessageandeverythingwouldbefine. ThePresidentindicatedinhispublicstatements that a pardon had not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that “[m]Jost people will flip if the Governmentlets them out oftrouble”but that he “d[idn’t] see Michael doing that.”

After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the President accused Cohen of “mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?),” called Cohen a “rat,” and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that Cohen’s family members had committed crimes. The evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turnedto attacks andintimidation to deter the provision of information or undermine Cohen’s credibility once Cohen began cooperating.

Nexus to an official proceeding. The President’s relevant conduct towards Cohen occurred whenthe President knew the Special Counsel’s Office, Congress, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District ofNew York were investigating Cohen’s conduct. The President acknowledged through his public statements and tweets that Cohen potentially could cooperate with the governmentinvestigations.

Intent. In analyzing the President’s intent in his actions towards Cohen as a potential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen’sinformation would shed adverse light on the President’s campaign-period conduct and statements.

Cohen’s false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit the congressional and DOJ Russia investigations—a goal that wasin the President’s interest, as reflected by the President’s own statements. During and after the campaign, the President made repeated statements that he had “no business” in Russia and said that there were “no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away.” As Cohen knew, and asherecalled communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen’s pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscowproject cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness ofthese statements.

In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscowproject, that the conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trumppossible travel to Russia to pursue the project. The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, because the project had the potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from Cohen and other records further establish that Cohen’s efforts to advance the project did not end in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen wasconsidering the timing for possible trips to Russia by him and Trumpin connection with the project.

The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the timeofCohen’sfalsestatementstoCongress. CohendiscussedtheprojectwiththePresidentin early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after hereleasedtothepublichisopeningremarkstoCongress—whichsaidtheproject“wasterminated in January of 2016”—the President’s personal counsel told him the President was pleased with what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. Andafter Cohen’sguilty plea, the President told reporters that he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the inference that he remained aware ofhis own involvementin the project and the period during the Campaign in which the project was’ being pursued.

The President’s public remarks following Cohen’s guilty plea also suggest that the President may have been concerned about what Cohentold investigators about the Trump Tower Moscowproject. At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from this Office about the project and other subjects, the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating with the government but Cohenhadnotyet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress. Accordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided to the government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing and substanceofhis discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly statedthathehadpersonallymadethedecisiontoabandontheproject. ThePresidentthendeclined to clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content and timing of the President’s provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concernedaboutthe
information that Cohen could provide as a witness.

The President’s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed at the Southern District ofNew Yorkinvestigation into other aspects ofthe President’s dealings with Cohenrather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow. There also is some evidence that the President’s concern about Cohen cooperating was based onthe President’s stated belief that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser sentencefor his unrelated criminal conduct. The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, refused to “break” and “makeupstories in order to get a ‘deal.’” And after Cohenpleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, the President said, “what [Cohen]’s trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So he’s lying about a project that everybody knew about.” But the President also appeared to defend the underlying conduct, saying, “Even if [Cohen] wasright, it doesn’t matter because I was allowed to do whateverI wanted during the campaign.” As described above, there is evidencethat the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump Tower Moscowproject and that Cohendid so to protect the President and minimizethe President’s connections to Russia during the campaign.

Finally, the President’s statements insinuating that members of Cohen’s family committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the governmentcould be viewed as an effort to retaliate against Cohen andchill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen or others. It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen “ma[d]e[] up stories” in order to get a deal for himself and “get his wife and father-in-law .. . off Scott Free.” ItalsoispossiblethatthePresident’smentionofCohen’swifeandfather-in-lawwerenotintended toaffectCohenasawitnessbutratherwerepartofapublic-relationsstrategyaimedatdiscrediting Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on Cohen-related matters. But the President’s suggestion that Cohen’s family members committed crimes happened morethan once, includingjustbeforeCohenwassentenced(atthesametimeasthePresidentstatedthatCohen “should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence”) and again just before Cohen was scheduledto testify before Congress. The timing ofthe statements supports an inferencethat they wereintendedatleast in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation.

\subsection{Overarching Factual Issues}

Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts concerning the President’s course of conduct.

Three features ofthis case renderit atypical compared to the heartland obstruction-of- justice prosecutions brought by the DepartmentofJustice.

First,theconductinvolvedactionsbythePresident. Someoftheconductdidnotimplicate the President’s constitutional authority and raises garden-variety obstruction-of-justice issues. Other events we investigated, however, drew upon the President’s Article II authority, which raisedconstitutionalissuesthatweaddressinVolumeII,SectionIII-B,infra. Afactualanalysis of that conduct would have to take into accountboth that the President’s acts were facially lawful and that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful meansofinfluencingofficial proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.

Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that he contemplated an effect on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 591 (2d Cir. 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense. See United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017)(stating, in applying the obstruction sentencing guideline, that “obstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the prosecutionis ultimately unsuccessfulor even ifthe investigation ultimately reveals no underlying crime”). Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminalliability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.

In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct. These include concernsthat continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events—such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’s release of hacked informationorthe June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaignofficials and Russians— could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign,or his family.

Third, many of the President’s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a corrupt intent, the President’s powerto influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his uniqueability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And noprinciple of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnessesoralter their testimony,the justice system’s integrity is equally threatened.

Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts—e.g., the President’s statement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his efforts to removetheSpecialCounsel—itisimportanttoviewthePresident’spatternofconductasawhole. That pattern shedslight on the nature of the President’s acts and the inferences that can be drawn abouthis intent.

OurinvestigationfoundmultipleactsbythePresidentthatwerecapableofexerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General’s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influencetheir testimony. Viewing
the acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example, the President’s direction to McGahnto have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by his direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia investigation to prospective election-interference only—a temporal connection that suggests that both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.

The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comeydid not endthe investigation ofFlynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahndid nottell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President’s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahnrefused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond thosealreadyfiled.

In considering the full scope of the conduct weinvestigated, the President’s actions can be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President’s motives. In the first phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the FBI had not opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination letter to Comeyafter other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful.

Soon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a significant change in the President’s conduct and the start of a second phase of action. The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the Special Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the investigation;hesoughttopreventpublicdisclosureofinformationabouttheJune9,2016meeting between Russians and campaignofficials; and he used public forumsto attack potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the government. Judgments about the nature of the President’s motives during each phase would be informed by thetotality of the evidence.
