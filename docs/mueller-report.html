<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>600.8(c), which
states that, &#8221;[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel&#8217;s work, he ... shall provide the
Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions
[the Special Counsel] reached.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and
systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in
mid-2016. In June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response
team publicly announced that Russian hackers had compromised its computer
network. Releases of hacked materials-hacks that public reporting soon attributed to
the Russian government-began that same month. Additional releases followed in
July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in October and
November.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks&#8217;s first release of stolen documents, a
foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump
Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested
to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had
received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign
through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July&#x00A0;31, 2016,
to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference
activities.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government &#8221;directed
recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political
organizations,&#8221; and, &#8221;[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US
election process.&#8221; After the election, in late December 2016, the United States
imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017,
several congressional committees were examining Russia&#8217;s interference in the
election.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017
appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the
Special Counsel authorized him to investigate &#8221;the Russian government&#8217;s efforts to
interfere in the 2016 presidential election,&#8221; including any links or coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation established that
Russia interfere in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First,
a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate
Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against
entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then
released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it
would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian
efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign
conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference
activities.

<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the
results of our investigation and the Special Counsel&#8217;s charging decisions, and we then
provide an overview of the two volumes of our report.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office found to be
supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report
points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or
event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office
to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation
established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation
did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those
facts.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals
constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of
&#8221;collusion.&#8221; In so doing, the Office recognized that the word &#8221;collud[e]&#8221; was used in
communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the
investigation&#8217;s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting
about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in
the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons,
the Office&#8217;s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as
defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question
whether members of the Trump Campaign&#8221; coordinat[ed]&#8221;&#8212;a term that appears in the
appointment order&#8212;with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion,
&#8221;coordination&#8221; does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood
coordination to require an agreement&#8212;tacit or express&#8212;between the Trump
Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the
other&#8217;s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when
stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump
Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference
activities.

 id="x1-50001"></a>Russian Social Media Campaign</h4>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference
operations identified by the investigation&#8212;a social media campaign designed
to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The
IRA was based in St.&#x00A0;Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian
oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Prigozhin is widely
reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, ________ ___ _____________

</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S.
political system through what it termed &#8221;information warfare.&#8221; The campaign evolved from
a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system,
to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged
candidate Clinton. The IRA&#8217;s operation also included the purchase of political
advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the
staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees
posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and
Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify
evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section
II of this report details the Office&#8217;s investigation of the Russian social media
campaign.

</p>
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-60001"></a>Russian Hacking Operations</h4>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in
early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber
intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General
Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the
GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole
hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.
Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government&#8217;s role
in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the
fictitious online personas &#8221;DCLeaks&#8221; and &#8221;Guccifer 2.0.&#8221; The GRU later released
additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (&#8221;Trump Campaign&#8221; or &#8221;Campaign&#8221;)
showed interest in WikiLeaks&#8217;s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to
damage candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016, ________ ___ _____________ __________ _________

of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically). ________ ___ _____________ __________ _________
______ ______ ___ _______ ___________ ___________ _____ ___ ___ ________ _______ WikiLeaks began
releasing Podesta&#8217;s stolen emails on October&#x00A0;7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media
outlet released video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this
Report details the Office&#8217;s investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as
well as other efforts by Trump Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related
emails.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-70001"></a>Russian Contacts with the Campaign</h4>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian
government. The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the
Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities.
Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would
benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the
Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released
through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump
Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election
interference activities.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy
positions seeking improved U.S.&#8211;Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the
contacts between Russia and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and
transition periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological
order.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">2015</span>. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump
Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate
Trump signed a Letter of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015,
and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen emailed and
spoke about the project with the office of Russian government press secretary
Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through at least
June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate
Trump.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Spring 2016</span>. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early
contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and
traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip,
Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had &#8221;dirt&#8221; on Hillary Clinton in
the form of thousands of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016,
Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump
Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could
assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging
to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months
thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a
meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took
place.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Summer 2016</span>. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer
of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for
President. On June&#x00A0;9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump
Campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul
Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as &#8221;official
documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.&#8221; The materials were offered to
Trump Jr.&#x00A0;as &#8221;part of Russia and its government&#8217;s support for Mr.&#x00A0;Trump.&#8221;
The written communications setting up the meeting showed that the Campaign
anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump&#8217;s
electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer&#8217;s presentation did not provide such
information.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Days after the June&#x00A0;9 meeting, on June&#x00A0;14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and
the DNC announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC
and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump, among other
documents.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal
capacity to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States,
Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was
later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page&#8217;s July
2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention.
The Campaign then distanced itself from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him
from the Campaign.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from
the DNC. On July&#x00A0;22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents
revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public
reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had &#8221;high confidence&#8221; that the Russian
government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And
within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its
May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian
government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July&#x00A0;31, 2016, based on the foreign
government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Separately, on August&#x00A0;2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New
York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses
to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a
peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office
was a &#8221;backdoor&#8221; way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men
believed the plan would require candidate Trump&#8217;s assent to succeed (were he to be
elected President). They also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and
Manafort&#8217;s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Months
before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with
Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August
meeting.
</p><!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Fall 2016</span>. On October&#x00A0;7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking
in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his
candidacy. Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John
Podesta&#8217; s emails that had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The
FBI and other U.S. government institutions were at the time continuing their
investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere in the presidential
election. That same day, October&#x00A0;7, the Department of Homeland Security and the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement &#8221;that
the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US
persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.&#8221; Those &#8221;thefts&#8221;
and the &#8221;disclosures&#8221; of the hacked materials through online platforms such as
WikiLeaks, the statement continued, &#8221;are intended to interfere with the US election
process.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Post-2016 Election</span>. Immediately after the November&#x00A0;8 election, Russian government
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts.
The Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the
President-Elect and to arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen
picked up the effort from there.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, was among
the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early
December, a business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump
Campaign and an associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince
later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.&#8211;Russia
relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a
friend of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition Team.
Dmitriev and Kushner&#8217;s friend collaborated on a short written reconciliation
plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been cleared
through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration,
and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   On December&#x00A0;29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having
interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian
Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response
to the sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not
take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later,
President-Elect Trump tweeted, &#8221;Great move on delay (by V. Putin).&#8221; The next day, on
December&#x00A0;31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at
the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result of Flynn&#8217;s
request.

<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   On January&#x00A0;6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect
Trump on a joint assessment&#8212;drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence
Agency, FBI, and National Security Agency&#8212;that concluded with high confidence that
Russia had intervened in the election through a variety of means to assist Trump&#8217;s
candidacy and harm Clinton&#8217;s. A declassified version of the assessment was publicly
released that same day.
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees&#8212;the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)&#8212;announced that they
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian
interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress
the existence of the FBI&#8217;s investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the
election. On March&#x00A0;20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey
stated:
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >
      </p><div class="quote">
      <!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that
      the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the
      Russian government&#8217;s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,
      and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals
      associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and
      whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia&#8217;s
      efforts.  ...  As  with  any  counterintelligence  investigation,  this  will  also
      include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.</p></div>
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until
May&#x00A0;9, 2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director&#8212;an action which is
analyzed in Volume II of the report.
</p><!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   On May&#x00A0;17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special
Counsel and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his
congressional testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any
other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. <span

interfere with or obstruct the investigation.
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel&#8217;s appointment. He told
advisors that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson
(Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel
removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation and prevent
the disclosure of evidence to it, including through public and private contacts with
potential witnesses. Those and related actions are described and analyzed in Volume II of
the report.

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-80001"></a>The Special Counsel&#8217;s Charging Decisions</h4>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume 1 of the report, the Office
determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law
chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>9-27.000 et
seq.&#x00A0;(2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct
constitutes a crime; if so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to
obtain and sustain a conviction; and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal
interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through
non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>9-27 .220.
</p><!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office&#8217;s charging decisions,
which contain three main components.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   First, the Office determined that Russia&#8217;s two principal interference operations in the
2016 U.S. presidential election&#8212;the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping
operations&#8212;violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the
social media campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to
defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the work of
federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as
well as related counts of identity theft. See <span 
class="cmti-12">United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Internet Research</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Agency, et al.</span>, No.&#x00A0;18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers
who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal
email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to
violate, among other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and
they have been so charged. <span 
class="cmti-12">See United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Netyksho, et al.</span>, No.&#x00A0;18-cr-215

</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties
to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the
evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the
evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered
agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence
about the June&#x00A0;9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks&#8217; s releases of hacked materials
was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the
evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign
conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016
election.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the
Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the
investigation of Russian election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as
violations of the federal false-statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak
during the transition period. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the
campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and
timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that
the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton .in the form of thousands of emails.
Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilt to making false
statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project. ________ ___ _____________

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Manafort lied to the

Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for
Ukraine.
</p>
<div class="center"

<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >__________</p></div>
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve
potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that
interactions between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at
the candidate&#8217;s April 2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week
of the Republican National Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the
investigation did not establish that one Campaign official&#8217;s efforts to dilute a
portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were
undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not
establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at
Sessions&#8217;s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential
campaign.
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a
complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some
individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and
were not, in the Office&#8217; s judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The
Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information&#8212;such as information known to
attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media&#8212;in light of internal
Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span>9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the
information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter ( or &#8221;taint&#8221;) team. Even when
individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that
was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above.
And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as
well&#8212;numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the
United States.
</p><!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose
conduct we investigated&#8212;including some associated with the Trump Campaign&#8212;deleted
relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications
that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or
communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness
statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully
question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known
facts.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office
believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified
gaps, the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information
would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the
report.

</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   The Acting Attorney General further clarified the scope of the Special Counsel&#8217;s
investigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda. A memorandum dated August&#x00A0;2,
2017, explained that the Appointment Order had been &#8221;worded categorically in order to
permit its public release without confirming specific investigations involving specific
individuals.&#8221; It then confirmed that the Special Counsel had been authorized since his
appointment to investigate allegations that three Trump campaign officials&#8212;Carter Page,
Paul Manafort, and George Papadopoulos&#8212;&#8221;committed a crime or crimes by
colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government&#8217;s
efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.&#8221; The memorandum also
confirmed the Special Counsel&#8217;s authority to investigate certain other matters,
including two additional sets of allegations involving Manafort (crimes arising from
payments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his
receipt of loans from a bank whose CEO was then seeking a position in the Trump
Administration); allegations that Papadopoulos committed a crime or crimes
by acting as an unregistered agent of the Israeli government; and four sets of
allegations involving Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor to President
Trump.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   On October&#x00A0;20, 2017, the Acting Attorney General confirmed in a memorandum the
Special Counsel&#8217;s investigative authority as to several individuals and entities.
First,&#8221; as part of a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government&#8217;s
efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,&#8221; the Special Counsel was
authorized to investigate &#8221;the pertinent activities of Michael Cohen, Richard
Gates,____  __  _  _  __  __  __  _ ___  _  _  __  __  __  __ , Roger Stone, and____  __  _  _  __  __  __  _ ___  _  _  __  __  __  __ &#8221; &#8221;Confirmation of
the authorization to investigate such individuals,&#8221; the memorandum stressed,
&#8221;does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a determination that any
of them has committed a crime.&#8221; Second, with respect to Michael Cohen, the
memorandum recognized the Special Counsel&#8217;s authority to investigate &#8221;leads relate[d]
to Cohen&#8217;s establishment and use of Essential Consultants LLC to, inter alia,
receive funds from Russian-backed entities.&#8221; Third, the memorandum memorialized
the Special Counsel&#8217;s authority to investigate individuals and entities who were
possibly engaged in &#8221;jointly undertaken activity&#8221; with existing subjects of the
investigation, including Paul Manafort. Finally, the memorandum described an FBI
investigation opened before the Special Counsel&#8217;s appointment into &#8221;allegations
that [then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions] made false statements to the United
States Senate[,]&#8221; and confirmed the Special Counsel&#8217;s authority to investigate that
matter.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority &#8221;to
exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.&#8221; 28
C.F.R:  600.6. Like a U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office, the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office considered a range
of classified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office&#8217;s
Russia investigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use
in prosecutions of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
warranted prosecution). There was substantial evidence immediately available to
the Special Counsel at the inception of the investigation in May 2017 because
the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian election interference for
nearly 10 months. The Special Counsel&#8217;s Office exercised its judgment regarding
what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a
contact between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and
entities.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   The Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the
Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain
proceedings associated with the Office&#8217;s work remain ongoing. After consultation with the
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those
remaining issues to other components of the Department of Justice and FBI. Appendix D
lists those transfers.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Two district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel&#8217;s authority to
investigate Russia election interference and links and/or coordination with the
Trump Campaign. See United States v.&#x00A0;Manafort, 312 F. Supp.&#x00A0;3d 60, 79&#8211;83
(D.D.C. 2018); United States v.&#x00A0;Manafort, 321 F. Supp.&#x00A0;3d 640, 650&#8211;655 (E.D.
Va.&#x00A0;2018). In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office periodically
identified evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the
Special Counsel&#8217;s authority established by the Acting Attorney General. After
consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office referred that
evidence to appropriate law enforcement authorities, principally other components
of the Department of Justice and to the FBI. Appendix D summarizes those
referrals.

<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   To carry out the investigation and prosecution of the matters assigned to him, the
Special Counsel assembled a team that at its high point included 19 attorneys&#8212;five of
whom joined the Office from private practice and 14 on detail or assigned from other
Department of Justice components. These attorneys were assisted by a filter team of
Department lawyers and FBI personnel who screened materials obtained via court process
for privileged information before turning those materials over to investigators; a support
staff of three paralegals on detail from the Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division; and an
administrative staff of nine responsible for budget, finance, purchasing, human resources,
records, facilities, security, information technology, and administrative support. The
Special Counsel attorneys and support staff were co-located with and worked
alongside approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, a
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
paralegal, and professional staff assigned by the FBI to assist the Special Counsel&#8217;s
investigation. Those &#8221;assigned&#8221; FBI employees remained under FBI supervision
at all times; the matters on which they assisted were supervised by the Special

<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   From its inception, the Office recognized that its investigation could identify foreign
intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI&#8217;s broader national
security mission. FBI personnel who assisted the Office established procedures to identify
and convey such information to the FBI. The FBI&#8217;s Counterintelligence Division met with
the Office regularly for that purpose for most of the Office&#8217;s tenure. For more than the past
year, the FBI also embedded personnel at the Office who did not work on the Special
Counsel&#8217;s investigation, but whose purpose was to review the results of the investigation
and to send&#8212;in writing&#8212;summaries of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence
information to FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices. Those communications and other
correspondence between the Office and the FBI contain information derived from the
investigation, not all of which is contained in this Volume. This Volume is a summary. It

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The first form of Russian election influence came principally from the
Internet Research Agency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by
Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and companies he controlled, including
Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering (collectively
&#8221;Concord&#8221;).<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x1" id="fn2x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10001f2"></a>
The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large U.S.
audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political
system.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x1" id="fn3x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10002f3"></a>
These operations constituted &#8221;active measures&#8221; ( ), a term that typically refers to operations
conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international
affairs.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as
2014. Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and
group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which
addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S.
activists. Over time, these social media accounts became a means to reach large
U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to the United States in mid-2014 on an
intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and photographs for use in their social
media posts.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the
2016 U.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting
the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various
expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on
social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S.
persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically
with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political
activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political
rallies.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn5x1" id="fn5x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10004f5"></a>
The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or
intentionally coordinated with the IRA&#8217;s interference operation.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S.
persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and
Instagram accounts had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants. IRA-controlled
Twitter accounts separately had tens of thousands of followers, including multiple U.S.
political figures who retweeted IRA-created content. In November 2017, a Facebook
representative testified that Facebook had identified 470 IRA-controlled Facebook accounts
that collectively made 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017. Facebook
estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Face book
accounts.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

In January 2018, Twitter announced that it had identified 3,814
IRA-controlled Twitter accounts and notified approximately 1.4 million

By early 2015, the IRA began to create larger social media groups or public
social media pages that claimed (falsely) to be affiliated with U.S. political

mimicked real U.S. organizations. For example, one IRA-controlled Twitter
account, TEN_GOP, purported to be connected to the Tennessee Republican
Party.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Rallies organized by the IRA </div>
<!--l. 401--><p class="indent" >   From June 2016 until the end of the presidential campaign, almost all of the U.S. rallies
organized by the IRA focused on the U.S. election, often promoting the Trump Campaign and
opposing the Clinton Campaign. Pro-Trump rallies included three in New York; a series of
pro-Trump rallies in Florida in August 2016; and a series of pro-Trump rallies in October

<!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also
targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims
included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries
of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those
entities.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling
stations.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While
the investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities,
the Office did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine
servers or other relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the
FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately
investigated that activity.
</p><!--l. 424--><p class="indent" >   By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer
networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local
governmental entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of
registered voters using a technique known as &#8221;SQL injection,&#8221; by which malicious code was
sent to the state or local website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database
contents).<span class="footnote-mark"><a

In one instance in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of
the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE&#8217;s website. The
GRU then gained access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois
voters,<span class="footnote-mark"><a

administration and personnel at companies involved in voting technology.
In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of ____________ ___________, a voting
technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to
manage voter rolls, and installed malware on the company network. Similarly, in
November 2016, the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts
used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S.
election.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious

The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes
that this operation enabled the GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida
county government. The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained
above, did not undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do
so.

Cohen described to Poliakova his position at the Trump Organization and
outlined the proposed Trump Moscow project, including information about the
Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization had partnered. Cohen
requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to build
the project and with financing. According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed
questions and took notes, stating that she would need to follow up with others in
Russia.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

as representatives of the Trump Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with

significantly. On one occasion, Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager
Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the candidate&#8217;s schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke
with Lewandowski, who suggested that they speak again when Cohen had actual dates to
evaluate. Cohen indicated, however, that he knew that travel prior to the Republican National

invitation to Roscongress. According to Foresman, the &#8221;concrete things&#8221; he referenced in
the same email were a combination of the invitation itself, Foresman&#8217;s personal
perspectives on the invitation and Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan
supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest Institute). Foresman told the Office that
Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him to another Republican
presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that Kobyakov had
asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate
withdrew from the race and the other politician&#8217;s participation did not work
out.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Finally, Foresman claimed to have no plans to establish a back channel involving Trump,
stating the reference to his involvement in the Bush&#8211;Putin back channel was meant to
burnish his credentials to the Campaign. Foresman commented that he had not recognized
any of the experts announced as Trump&#8217;s foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted
to secure an in-person meeting with the candidate to share his professional background and
policy views, including that Trump should decline Kobyakov&#8217;s invitation to speak at the
Forum.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

In late April 2016, Papadopoulos was told by London-based professor Joseph Mifsud,
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
immediately after Mifsud&#8217;s return from a trip to Moscow, that the Russian government had
obtained &#8221;dirt&#8221; on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. One week later,
on May&#x00A0;6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that
the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could
assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be
damaging to candidate Clinton.
</p><!--l. 463--><p class="indent" >   Papadopoulos shared information about Russian &#8221;dirt&#8221; with people outside of the
Campaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official.
Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that
they did not recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughout the
relevant period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with
Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the
Russian government. That meeting never came to pass.

As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign

Glassner passed along word of Papadopoulos&#8217;s interest to another campaign official, Joy
Lutes, who notified Papadopoulos by email that she had been told by Glassner to introduce
Papadopoulos to Sam Clovis, the Trump Campaign&#8217;s national co-chair and chief policy

</p><!--l. 495--><p class="indent" >   At the time of Papadopoulos&#8217;s March&#x00A0;2 email, the media was criticizing the Trump

   Whatever Sessions&#8217;s precise words at the March&#x00A0;31 meeting, Papadopoulos did not
understand Sessions or anyone else in the Trump Campaign to have directed that he
refrain from making further efforts to arrange a meeting between the Campaign
and the Russian government. To the contrary, Papadopoulos told the Office that
he understood the Campaign to be supportive of his efforts to arrange such a
meeting.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

For example, within a week of her initial March&#x00A0;24 meeting with him, Polonskaya attempted
to send Papadopoulos a text message&#8212;which email exchanges show to have been drafted or
edited by Mifsud&#8212;addressing Papadopoulos&#8217;s &#8221;wish to engage with the Russian

When Papadopoulos learned from Mifsud that Polonskaya had
tried to message him, he sent her an email seeking another

Polonskaya responded the next day that she was &#8221;back in St. Petersburg&#8221; but &#8221;would be very

Papadopoulos stated in reply that he thought &#8221;a good step&#8221; would be to introduce him
to &#8221;the Russian Ambassador in London,&#8221; and that he would like to talk to the

On April&#x00A0;18, 2016, while in Russia, Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email
to Ivan Timofeev, a member of the Russian International Affairs Council
(RIAC).<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-68016f456"></a>
Mifsud had described Timofeev as having connections with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MFA),<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Over the next several weeks, Papadopoulos and Timofeev had multiple
conversations over Skype and email about setting &#8221;the groundwork&#8221; for
a &#8221;potential&#8221; meeting between the Campaign and Russian government
officials.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Papadopoulos told the Office that, on one Skype call, he believed that his conversation
with Timofeev was being monitored or supervised by an unknown third party, because
Timofeev spoke in an official manner and Papadopoulos heard odd noises on the
line.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Timofeev also told Papadopoulos in an April&#x00A0;25, 2016 email that he had just
spoken &#8221;to Igor Ivanov[,] the President of RIAC and former Foreign Minister of
Russia,&#8221; and conveyed Ivanov&#8217;s advice about how best to arrange a &#8221;Moscow

During that meeting, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had met with high-level
Russian government officials during his recent trip to Moscow. Mifsud also said
that, on the trip, he learned that the Russians had obtained &#8221;dirt&#8221; on candidate
Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the
&#8221;dirt&#8221; was in the form of &#8221;emails of Clinton,&#8221; and that they &#8221;have thousands of
emails.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

On May&#x00A0;6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos suggested to a
representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received
indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through
the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary
Clinton.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

campaign officials with Russian government officials, Papadopoulos kept campaign
officials apprised of his efforts. On April&#x00A0;25, 2016, the day before Mifsud told
Papadopoulos about the emails, Papadopoulos wrote to senior policy advisor
Stephen Miller that &#8221;[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for
Mr.&#x00A0;Trump to meet him when he is ready,&#8221; and that &#8221;[t]he advantage of being in
London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in &#8217;neutral&#8217;
cities.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

April&#x00A0;27, 2016, after his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos wrote a second message to Miller

The same day, Papadopoulos sent a similar email to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski,
telling Lewandowski that Papadopoulos had &#8221;been receiving a lot of calls over the last
month about Putin wanting to host [Trump] and the team when the time is right.

Papadopoulos&#8217;s recollection is consistent with emails sent before and after the

emails or that Russia could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of
information about Clinton. Papadopoulos stated that he could not clearly recall

<!--l. 1153--><p class="noindent" >Members of the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the
National Interest (CNI), principally through its President and Chief Executive Officer,
Dimitri Simes. CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian
government. Simes was born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United
States in the 1970s. In April 2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign
policy and national security at an event hosted by the National Interest, a publication
affiliated with CNI. Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and Russian Ambassador Kislyak both
attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in relation to Sessions&#8217;s
confirmation hearings to become Attorney General. Sessions had various other
contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including
Russia. Jared Kushner also interacted with Simes about Russian issues during the
campaign. The investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed
or received any messages to or from the Russian government through CNI or
Simes.

</p><!--l. 1320--><p class="indent" >   In the summer of 2016, CNI organized at least two dinners in
Washington, D.C. for Sessions to meet with experienced foreign policy
professionals.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The dinners included CNI-affiliated individuals, such as Richard Burt and
Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq and the
person who had introduced Trump before the April&#x00A0;27, 2016 foreign-policy
speech.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

At the dinners and in the meetings, the participants addressed U.S. relations with Russia,
including how U.S. relations with NATO and European countries affected U.S. policy toward
Russia.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn644x1" id="fn644x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">644</sup></a></span><a

   Between the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the
presidential election, Jared Kushner had periodic contacts with
Simes.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn648x1" id="fn648x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">648</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-81001f648"></a>
Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings and phone conversations, which
concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the Campaign and how to
move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes had

Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia,
and that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with
Russians.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn650x1" id="fn650x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">650</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-81003f650"></a>
According to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of
Russian contacts with Kushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop
hidden Russian contacts, and told Kushner both that the Campaign should not
highlight Russia as an issue and should handle any contacts with Russians with
care.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn651x1" id="fn651x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">651</sup></a></span><a

</p><!--l. 1363--><p class="indent" >   Among the Kushner&#8211;Simes meetings was one held on August&#x00A0;17, 2016, at Simes&#8217;s request,
in Kushner&#8217;s New York office. The meeting was to address foreign policy advice that CNI was
providing and how to respond to the Clinton Campaign&#8217;s Russia-related attacks on candidate
Trump.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn653x1" id="fn653x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">653</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-81006f653"></a>
In advance of the meeting, Simes sent Kushner a &#8221;Russia Policy
Memo&#8221; laying out &#8221;what Mr.&#x00A0;Trump may want to say about
Russia.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn654x1" id="fn654x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">654</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-81007f654"></a>
In a cover email transmitting that memo and a phone call to set up the meeting,
Simes mentioned &#8221;a well-documented story of highly questionable connections
between Bill Clinton&#8221; and the Russian government, &#8221;parts of [which]&#8221; (according
to Simes) had even been &#8221;discussed with the CIA and the FBI in the late
1990s and shared with the [Independent Counsel] at the end of the Clinton
presidency.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn655x1" id="fn655x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">655</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-81008f655"></a>
Kushner forwarded the email to senior Trump Campaign officials Stephen
Miller, Paul Manafort, and Rick Gates, with the note &#8221;suggestion
only.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn656x1" id="fn656x1-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">656</sup></a></span><a

Simes claimed that he had received this information from former CIA and Reagan White House

Russians.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 1394--><p class="indent" >   Simes perceived that Kushner did not find the information to be

When interviewed by the Office, Kushner stated that he believed that there was little chance of
something new being revealed about the Clintons given their long career as public figures, and

<!--l. 1404--><p class="noindent" >On June&#x00A0;9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with
a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from
the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr.&#x00A0;in an email
from Robert Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the
son of Russian real-estate developer Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump
Jr.&#x00A0;that the &#8221;Crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump Campaign
with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary
and her dealings with Russia&#8221; as &#8221;part of Russia and its government&#8217;s support
for Mr.&#x00A0;Trump.&#8221; Trump Jr.&#x00A0;immediately responded that &#8221;if it&#8217;s what you say
I love it,&#8221; and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephone
calls.
</p><!--l. 1409--><p class="indent" >   Trump Jr.&#x00A0;invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared
Kushner to attend the meeting, and both attended. Members of the Campaign
discussed the meeting before it occurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump
Jr.&#x00A0;may have told candidate Trump about an upcoming meeting to receive adverse
information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to Russia. According to written
answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of learning of the
meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing
that he was made aware of the meeting &#8211; or its Russian connection-before it
occurred.
</p><!--l. 1413--><p class="indent" >   The Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had
previously worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that
government throughout this period of time. She claimed that funds derived from
illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.
Trump Jr.&#x00A0;requested evidence to support those claims, but Veselnitskaya did
not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique
of the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and
travel sanctions on Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on
adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr.&#x00A0;suggested that the issue could be revisited
when and if candidate Trump was elected. After the election, Veselnitskaya made
additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump Transition Team did not
engage.

brief and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately
before the Convention, J.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and
national security, diluted a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform

Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee personnel revise the
proposed amendment to state that only &#8221;appropriate&#8221; assistance be provided

that Gordon told her (the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate
Trump in connection with his request to dilute the language. Gordon denied
making that statement to the sponsor, although he acknowledged it was possible he
mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the subject matter.
The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the
candidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because
he believed the proposed language was inconsistent with Trump&#8217;s position on
Ukraine.

Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg
Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Manafort stayed
in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin Kilimnik, a
longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort&#8217;s office in Kiev and who the FBI
assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.

to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign&#8212;including internal
polling data, although Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction.
Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information with others in Ukraine and
with Deripaska. Gates periodically sent such polling data to Kilimnik during the
campaign.
</p><!--l. 2114--><p class="indent" >   Manafort also twice met Kilimnik in the United States during the campaign
period and conveyed campaign information. The second meeting took place on
August&#x00A0;2, 2016, in New York City. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver
in person a message from former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who
was then living in Russia. The message was about a peace plan for Ukraine that
Manafort has since acknowledged was a &#8221;backdoor&#8221; means for Russia to control
eastern Ukraine. Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik
wrote an email to Manafort expressing the view&#8212;which Manafort later said he
shared&#8212;that the plan&#8217;s success would require U.S. support to succeed: &#8221;all that is
required to start the process is a very minor &#8217;wink&#8217; (or slight push) from [Donald

The investigation did not uncover evidence of Manafort&#8217;s passing along information about
Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or the Administration.
The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort&#8217;s electronic
communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications).
And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new
Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the
peace plan and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was
among the reasons that the district judge found that he breached his cooperation
agreement.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be &#8221;good for
business&#8221; and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in the
Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with
him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a &#8221;disagreement&#8221;&#8212;a
reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort&#8217;s
credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data
after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others
he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a
connection between Manafort&#8217;s sharing polling data and Russia&#8217;s interference
in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the
time of the August&#x00A0;2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort
otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference
efforts.

   Manafort&#8217;s Russian contacts during the campaign and transition periods stem from his
consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate
political consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his
company DMP International LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev
during this entire period and continued to communicate with Manafort through
at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes Ukrainian and Russian,
facilitated many of Manafort&#8217;s communications with Deripaska and Ukrainian
oligarchs.

</p><!--l. 2516--><p class="indent" >   Manafort&#8217;s activities in early 2017 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.
The first meeting, which took place in Madrid, Spain in January 2017, was with Georgiy
Oganov. Oganov, who had previously worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States,
was a senior executive at a Deripaska company and was believed to report directly to
Deripaska.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Manafort initially denied attending the meeting. When he later acknowledged it, he
claimed that the meeting had been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles
lawsuit.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Other evidence, however, provides reason to doubt Manafort&#8217;s statement that the sole
topic of the meeting was the Pericles lawsuit. In particular, text messages to
Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik suggest that Kilimnik and
Boyarkin&#8212;not Manafort&#8217;s counsel&#8212;had arranged the meeting between Manafort and
Oganov.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Kilimnik&#8217;s message states that the meeting was supposed to be &#8221;not
about money or Pericles&#8221; but instead &#8221;about recreating [the] old
friendship&#8221;&#8212;ostensibly between Manafort and Deripaska&#8212;&#8221;and talking about global
politics.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 2684--><p class="noindent" >Aven&#8217;s description of his interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill
Dmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund and is closely
connected to Putin. Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump
Administration in the months after the election. Dmitriev asked a close business associate who
worked for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him
to Trump transition officials, and Nader eventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles
between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a Trump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve
Bannon.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-110001f989"></a>
In addition, the UAE national security advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund
manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick Gerson, in late November 2016. In
December 2016 and January 2017, Dmitriev and Gerson worked on a proposal for
reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied he
cleared through Putin. Gerson provided that proposal to Kushner before the
inauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson.

2016 meeting with incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his
designated deputy (K.T. McFarland) in New York, Flynn asked Foresman for
his thoughts on Kislyak. Foresman had not met Kislyak but told Flynn that,

<!--l. 3370--><p class="noindent" >Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team&#8217;s
primary conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt
with Russia on two sensitive matters during the transition period: a United

Despite Kushner&#8217;s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside the Russian
government, the Transition Team turned to Flynn&#8217;s relationship with Kislyak on both
issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming
deputy, to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect
and other senior members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Although transition officials at Mar-a-Lago had some concern about possible
Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did not identify evidence that
the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn asked
Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on
December&#x00A0;29, 2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that
request.

<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office &#8220;to prosecute federal
crimes arising from [its] investigation&#8221; of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to
exercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal
Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney&#8217;s) Manual. In particular,
the Office has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for
prosecution constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would
probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction for such an offense.
Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those questions was yes,
the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial
federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another
jurisdiction, and there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.

</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets
of Russian nationals for their roles in perpetrating the active-measures social media
campaign and computer-intrusion operations. ________ ___ _____________ _________ The Office
similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked
individuals either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of
campaign-finance offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a
criminal conviction. At the same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal
Prosecution supported charging certain individuals connected to the Campaign with
making false statements or otherwise obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional
investigations.

</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump
Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S.
person with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did
not identify evidence that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated
with the IRA knew that he or she was speaking with Russian nationals engaged
in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore determined that such persons
did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge them in the
conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count
alleging a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual
Russian nationals (Count Two). The Office did, however, charge one U.S. national
for his role in supplying false or stolen bank account numbers that allowed the
IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems by circumventing those
systems&#8217; security features. On February&#x00A0;12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty,
pursuant to a single-count information, to identity fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >As explained in Section IV above, the Office&#8217;s investigation uncovered evidence of
numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or
claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under
several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents
who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did
not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section
IV above&#8212;with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates
based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump
Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals&#8212;the June&#x00A0;9, 2016 meeting between
high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on
Hillary Clinton&#8212;implicates an additional body of law: campaign finance statutes.
Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources
raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As explained below, the
Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June&#x00A0;9 meeting ________ ___
________ ________. The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal
questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter
difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign
willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between
Campaign officials and Russia affiliated individuals may not have been sufficient
to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connected to the
Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to
obstruct the Office&#8217;s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore

 id="x1-1330001."></a>Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion</h5>
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the
collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of &#8220;collusion,&#8221; but through the
lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word &#8220;collud[e]&#8221;
appears in the Acting Attorney General&#8217;s August&#x00A0;2, 2017 memorandum; it has
frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in
antitrust law, see, <span 
class="cmti-12">e.g., Brooke Group v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</span>, 509
U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability
found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the
contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with
conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18
U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>371. See <span 
class="cmti-12">Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary </span>321 (10th ed.&#x00A0;2014) (collusion is &#8220;[a]n
agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law&#8221;); 1
Alexander Burrill, <span 
class="cmti-12">A Law Dictionary and Glossary </span>311 (1871) (&#8220;An agreement
between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ
such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.&#8221;); 1 <span

a person of his rights by the forms of law,or to obtain an object forbidden by
law.&#8221;).
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >   For that reason, this Office&#8217;s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability
was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term &#8220;collusion.&#8221;
The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials
and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy&#8212;either
under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span>1349,
1951(a)), or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>371). The investigation
did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>,
amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal
law&#8212;including foreign-influence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed
further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with
the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from
Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371&#8217;s offenses
clause.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy
under Section 371&#8217;s defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement
to obstruct a lawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or
dishonest means. See <span

establish any agreement among Campaign officials&#8212;or between such officials and
Russia-linked individuals&#8212;to interfere with or obstruct a lawful function of a
government agency during the campaign or transition period. And, as discussed in
Volume I, Section V.A, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, the investigation did not identify evidence that
any Campaign official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in
the conspiracy to defraud that the Office charged, namely, the active-measures
conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, <span

charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with conspiracy to defraud

   The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort&#8217;s and
Richard Gates&#8217;s pre-campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA.
Manafort and Gates were charged for that conduct and admitted to it when they
pleaded guilty to superseding criminal informations in the District of Columbia

The evidence underlying those charges is not addressed in this report because it was

to the Acting Attorney General before the original indictment in that case. In addition, the
investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael Flynn. Those potential
violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (<span

within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control
of the government of Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find

</p><!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >   In brief, the key facts are that, on June&#x00A0;3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald

prosecutor&#8221; to &#8220;the Trump campaign&#8221; of &#8220;official documents and information that would
incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.&#8217;s]
father.&#8221; The email described this as &#8220;very high level and sensitive information&#8221; that is
&#8220;part of Russia and its government&#8217;s support to Mr.&#x00A0;Trump-helped along by
Aras and Emin.&#8221; Trump Jr.&#x00A0;responded: &#8220;if it&#8217;s what you say I love it especially
later in the summer.&#8221; Trump Jr.&#x00A0;and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations
and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was
attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the
meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an
inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and
information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump&#8217;s electoral
prospects.
</p><!--l. 244--><p class="indent" >   This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and
donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>30121(a)(1)(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed
along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide &#8220;official
documents and information&#8221; to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the
presidential election. Trump Jr.&#x00A0;appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a
meeting to receive those materials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains
supports the inference that Kushner and Manafort were aware of that purpose and
attended the June&#x00A0;9 meeting anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the
Campaign from Russian sources.
</p><!--l. 249--><p class="indent" >   The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the
foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>371; the solicitation of an
illegal foreign source contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of &#8220;an express

of 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). There are reasonable arguments that the
offered information would constitute a &#8220;thing of value&#8221; within the meaning of these
provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely
to obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did
not obtain admissible evidence likely to meet the government&#8217;s burden to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals acted &#8220;willfully,&#8221; i.e., with general
knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, second, the government would likely

candidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an
election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could
apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, but also by
the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns
frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged
in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert
a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor
to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value. At the same
time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensated
opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to
a contribution under campaign-finance law. Such an interpretation could have
implications beyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>30116(a) (imposing monetary
limits on campaign contributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those
questions could be especially difficult where the information consisted simply of the
recounting of historically accurate facts. It is uncertain how courts would resolve those
issues.

class="cmbx-12">Willfulness</span></span> Even assuming that the promised &#8220;documents and information that
would incriminate Hillary&#8221; constitute a &#8220;thing of value&#8221; under campaign-finance law, the
government would encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction.
Most significantly, the government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to
establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant
acted &#8220;knowingly and willfully,&#8221; the government would have to show that the defendant
had general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, <span

class="cmti-12">Danielczyk</span>, 917 F. Supp.&#x00A0;2d at 577 (&#8220;knowledge of
general unlawfulness&#8221;). &#8220;This standard creates an elevated scienter element requiring,at the
very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear.
When there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts
of a particular matter, the offender is more likely to have an intent defense.&#8221;
<span 
class="cmti-12">Election Offenses </span>123. On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June&#x00A0;9 meeting participants had
general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. The investigation has not
developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the
foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual
context. The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
efforts at concealment at the time of the June&#x00A0;9 meeting. While the government
has evidence of later efforts to prevent disclosure of the nature of the June&#x00A0;9
meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a showing of scienter, <span 
class="cmti-12">see</span>
Volume II, Section II.G, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>, that concealment occurred more than a year later,
involved individuals who did not attend the June&#x00A0;9 meeting, and may reflect an
intention to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality.
Additionally, in light of the unresolved legal questions about whether giving &#8220;documents
and information&#8221; of the sort offered here constitutes a campaign contribution,
Trump Jr.&#x00A0;could mount a factual defense that he did not believe his response to
the offer and the June&#x00A0;9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his less direct
involvement in arranging the June&#x00A0;9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar
defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has
not developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal
issues.

 id="x1-142000iii."></a><span 
class="cmbx-12">Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information</span></span> The Office would also encounter
difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents and
information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well as the $25,000
threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>30109(d)(1). The type of evidence
commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions&#8212;such as pricing the
contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost or the
cost of distribution&#8212;would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting.
Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that
the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a
conspiracy may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time
of the agreement, <span 
class="cmti-12">see, e.g., United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Tombrello</span>, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th
Cir.&#x00A0;1982), Goldstone&#8217;s description of the offered material here was quite general. His
suggestion of the information&#8217;s value&#8212;i.e., that it would &#8220;incriminate Hillary&#8221; and
&#8220;would be very useful to [Trump Jr.&#8217;s] father&#8221;&#8212;was nonspecific and may have been
understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given Goldstone&#8217;s lack of direct
access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be delivered could
be reflected in Trump Jr.&#8217;s response (&#8220;<span 
class="cmti-12">if it&#8217;s what you say </span>I love it&#8221;) (emphasis
added).
   Accordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in
a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required
valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against
Trump Jr.&#x00A0;or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June&#x00A0;9
meeting.

government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non-jurisdictional

material. <span

based on his role as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to
a foreign government representative that Russia had indicated that it could assist the
Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton.
On January&#x00A0;27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents, who informed
him that the interview was part of the investigation into potential Russian government
interference in the 2016 presidential election. During the interview, Papadopoulos
lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his communications with Joseph
Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to timing, Papadopoulos
acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians
had &#8220;dirt&#8221; on Clinton in the form of &#8220;thousands of emails.&#8221; But Papadopoulos
stated multiple times that those communications occurred before he joined the
Trump Campaign and that it was a &#8220;very strange coincidence&#8221; to be told of
the &#8220;dirt&#8221; before he started working for the Campaign. This account was false.
Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March&#x00A0;14, 2016,
after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for
the Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of
his role on the Campaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians
possessing &#8220;dirt&#8221; on candidate Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after
Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and been publicly announced by candidate
Trump. Statement of Offense <span

up connections or something,&#8220;and that he believed Mifsud was &#8220;BS&#8217;ing to be
completely honest with you.&#8221; In fact, however, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to
have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that
Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling Papadopoulos
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
about the &#8220;dirt.&#8221; Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over
a period of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign,
including efforts to arrange a &#8220;history making&#8221; meeting between the Campaign
and Russian government officials. In addition, Papadopoulos failed to inform
investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev, the Russian national who
Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or &#8220;[a]nyone

cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have
misunderstood their conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen
Papadopoulos since the meeting at which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even
though emails, text messages, and other information show that Mifsud met with
Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions&#8212;April&#x00A0;12 and April&#x00A0;26, 2016. In
addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up message
that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that,
as reflected in the language of that email chain (&#8220;Baby, thank you!&#8221;), Mifsud
may have been involved in a personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time.
The false information and omissions in Papadopoulos&#8217;s January 2017 interview
undermined investigators&#8217; ability to challenge Mifsud when he made these inaccurate
statements.

class="cmbx-12">Michael Flynn</span></span> Michael Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI on January&#x00A0;24,
2017, four days after he had officially assumed his duties as National Security Advisor to
the President. During the interview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his
communications with the Russian ambassador. First, Flynn made two false statements
about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Kislyak in late December 2016, at a time
when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering with the
2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Flynn</span>
Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain
from escalating the situation in response to the United States&#8217;s imposition of
sanctions. That statement was false. On December&#x00A0;29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to
request Russian restraint. Flynn made the call immediately after speaking to a
senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about what to communicate
to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to
report on the substance of that conversation. Flynn also falsely told the FBI
that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that
Russia had chosen to moderate its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of
Flynn&#8217;s request. On December&#x00A0;31, 2016, Flynn in fact had such a conversation with
Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the call to relay
the substance of his conversation with Kislyak. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Flynn </span>Statement of Offense
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¶</span>3.
   Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to
representatives of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to
the United Nations Security Council on December&#x00A0;21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that
he only asked the countries&#8217; positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he
did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That
statement was false. On December&#x00A0;22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the
incoming Trump Administration&#8217;s opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia
vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn also falsely stated that Kislyak never described
Russia&#8217;s response to his December&#x00A0;22 request regarding the resolution. Kislyak in
fact told Flynn in a conversation on December&#x00A0;23, 2016, that Russia would not

</p><!--l. 436--><p class="indent" >   Flynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as
National Security Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian

(&#8220;<span 
class="cmti-12">Cohen </span>Information&#8221;). From the fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen
was involved in a project to build a Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in
Moscow. The project was known as Trump Tower Moscow. In 2017, Cohen was called to
testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were investigating Russian
interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between Russia and
the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony,
Cohen caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing
Trump Tower Moscow. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cohen </span>Information <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¶¶</span>2&#8211;3. The letter contained three
representations relevant here. First, Cohen stated that the Trump Moscow project had
ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate Trump on the project
only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. Second,
Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the
project and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen
stated that he did not recall any Russian government contact about the project,
including any response to an email that he had sent to a Russian government email
account. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cohen </span>Information <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¶</span>4. Cohen later asked that his two-page statement be
incorporated into his testimony&#8217;s transcript before SSCI, and he ultimately gave
testimony to SSCI that was consistent with that statement. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cohen </span>Information
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¶</span>5.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
   Each of the foregoing representations in Cohen&#8217;s two-page statement was false and
misleading. Consideration of the project had extended through approximately June 2016
and included more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed
with Felix Sater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about
the possibility of Trump traveling there&#8212;both with the candidate himself and with senior
campaign official Corey Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a
response to the email that he sent to Russian government spokesman Dmitry
Peskov&#8212;in particular, that he received an email reply and had a follow-up phone
conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cohen</span>
Information <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¶</span>7. Cohen knew the statements in the letter to be false at the time, and
admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the
project and Trump (who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false
impression that the project had ended before the first vote in the Republican
Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations.
<span 
class="cmti-12">Id</span>.
</p><!--l. 470--><p class="indent" >   Given the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during
his initial interview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section
1001. On November&#x00A0;29, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement
to a single-count information charging him with making false statements in a
matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern
District of New York (after a referral from our Office). On December&#x00A0;7, 2018, this
Office submitted a letter to that judge recommending that Cohen&#8217;s cooperation
with our investigation be taken into account in sentencing Cohen on both the
false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern District prosecution. On
December&#x00A0;12, 2018, the judge sentenced Cohen to two months of imprisonment on the
false-statements count, to run concurrently with a 36-month sentence imposed on the other

class="cmbx-12">Jeff Sessions</span></span> As set forth in Volume I, Section IV.A.6, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>,the investigation
established that, while a U.S. Senator and a Trump Campaign advisor, former Attorney
General Jeff Sessions interacted with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the week of the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Republican National Convention in July 2016 and again at a meeting in Sessions&#8217;s
Senate office in September 2016. The investigation also established that Sessions
and Kislyak both attended a reception held before candidate Trump&#8217;s foreign
policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in April 2016, and
that it is possible that they met briefly at that reception. The Office considered
whether,in light of these interactions, Sessions committed perjury before, or made
false statements to, Congress in connection with his confirmation as Attorney
General. In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions
stated in response to a question about Trump Campaign communications with the
Russian government that he had &#8220;been called a surrogate at a time or two in that
campaign and I didn&#8217;t have &#8211; did not have communications with the Russians.&#8221; In
written responses submitted on January&#x00A0;17, 2017, Sessions answered &#8220;[n]o&#8221; to
a question asking whether he had &#8220;been in contact with anyone connected to
any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or
after election day.&#8221; And, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions
identified two of the campaign-period contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above,
which had been reported in the media following the January 2017 confirmation
hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did &#8220;not recall any
discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representatives of the Russian
government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other
occasion.&#8221;
   Although the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the
occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at
least one occasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false
answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions.
With respect to Sessions&#8217;s statements that he did &#8220;not recall any discussions with the
Russian Ambassador.. . regarding the political campaign&#8221; and he had not been in contact
with any Russian official &#8220;about the 2016 election,&#8221; the evidence concerning the nature of
Sessions&#8217;s interactions with Kislyak makes it plausible that Sessions did not recall
discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of his statements. Similarly,
while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he &#8220;did not have
communications with Russians,&#8221; he did so in response to a question that had linked such
communications to an alleged &#8220;continuing exchange of information&#8221; between the
Trump Campaign and Russian government intermediaries. Sessions later explained
to the Senate and to the Office that he understood the question as narrowly
calling for disclosure of interactions with Russians that involved the exchange of
campaign information, as distinguished from more routine contacts with Russian
nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that understanding is
plausible.
</p><!--l. 501--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly,the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that
Sessions was willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a
conviction for perjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal

informed his counsel of that decision in March 2018.

states that, [a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsels work, he ... shall provide the
Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions
[the Special Counsel] reached.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards
the ongoing FBI investigation into Russias interference in the 2016 presidential election and
related matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice. The Order
appointing the Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that
arose directly from the FBIs Russia investigation, including whether the President had
obstructed justice in connection with Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsels
jurisdiction also covered potentially obstructive acts related to the Special Counsels
investigation itself. This Volume of our report summarizes our obstruction-of-justice
investigation of the President.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   We first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation,
and then provide an overview of this Volume:
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to
initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional
prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion
finding that the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would
impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its
constitutionally assigned functions in violation of the constitutional separation of
powers.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x2" id="fn1x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-159001f1"></a>
Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the
framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>515; 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>600.7(a), this
Office accepted OLCs legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction.
And apart from OLCs constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation
against a sitting President would place burdens on the Presidents capacity to
govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential
misconduct.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x2" id="fn2x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-159002f2"></a>
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be
prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the Presidents term is
permissible.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x2" id="fn3x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-159003f3"></a>
The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves
office.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x2" id="fn4x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-159004f4"></a>
And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be
prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong
public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a
thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh
and documentary materials were available.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under
the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions,
but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a
judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice
Manual standards is to assess whether a persons conduct constitutes a federal
offense. U.S. Dept of Justice, Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>9-27.220 (2018) (Justice Manual).
Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when
no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond
to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural
protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly
accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutors
judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords

</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened
in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutors accusation of a
crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the
realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns about sealed indictments.
Even if an indictment were sealed during the Presidents term, OLC reasoned, it
would be very difficult to preserve [an indictments] secrecy, and if an indictment
became public, [t]he stigma and opprobrium could imperil the Presidents ability to
govern.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-159006f6"></a>
Although a prosecutors internal report would not represent a formal public accusation akin
to an indictment, the possibility of the reports public disclosure and the absence of a
neutral adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially
determining that the persons conduct constitutes a federal offense. Justice Manual

President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the
facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.
The evidence we obtained about the Presidents actions and intent presents difficult issues
that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.
Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it
also does not exonerate him.

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >During the 2016 presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian governments
apparent support for candidate Trump. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging
Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump
publicly expressed skepticism that Russia was responsible for the hacks at the same time
that he and other Campaign officials privately sought information about any further
planned WikiLeaks releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to
Russia, even though as late as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a
licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.
After the election, the President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of
Russias election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his
election.

<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >In mid-January 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to
the Vice President, other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to
Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Russias response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for
its election interference. On January 27, the day after the President was told that Flynn
had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements to the FBI, the President
invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White House and told Comey that
he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President requested Flynns
resignation, the President told an outside advisor, Now that we fired Flynn, the
Russia thing is over. The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would
continue.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
meeting with Comey. Referring to the FBIs investigation of Flynn, the President said, I
hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I
hope you can let this go. Shortly after requesting Flynns resignation and speaking privately
to Comey, the President sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T.
McFarland draft an internal letter stating that the President had not directed Flynn to
discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know
whether that was true, and a White House Counsels Office attorney thought that
the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been
offered.

 id="x1-1640002"></a>The Presidents reaction to the continuing Russia investigation.</h5>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >In February 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse
himself from campaign related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign.
In early March, the President told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions
from recusing. And after Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President
expressed anger at the decision and told advisors that he should have an Attorney General
who would protect him. That weekend, the President took Sessions aside at an event and
urged him to unrecuse. Later in March, Comey publicly disclosed at a congressional
hearing that the FBI was investigating the Russian governments efforts to interfere
in the 2016 presidential election, including any links or coordination between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the
President reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask
them what they could do to publicly dispel the suggestion that the President
had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. The President
also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to
avoid direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously
assured the President that the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the
President asked Comey to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation by saying that
publicly.

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1650002"></a>The Presidents termination of Comey.</h5>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >On May 3, 2017, Comey testified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer
questions about whether the President was personally under investigation. Within days, the
President decided to terminate Comey. The President insisted that the termination letter,
which was written for public release, state that Comey had informed the President that he
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White House maintained that
Comeys termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney
General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling
the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire
Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Comey,
the President told Russian officials that he had faced great pressure because of
Russia, which had been taken off by Comeys firing. The next day, the President
acknowledged in a television interview that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the
Department of Justices recommendation and that when he decided to just do it,
he was thinking that this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. In
response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia
investigation, the President said, As far as Im concerned, I want that thing to be
absolutely done properly, adding that firing Comey might even lengthen out the
investigation.

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1660002"></a>The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him.</h5>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >On May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a
Special Counsel to conduct the investigation and related matters. The President reacted to
news that a Special Counsel had been appointed by telling advisors that it was the end
of his presidency and demanding that Sessions resign. Sessions submitted his
resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The President told aides
that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special
Counsel therefore could not serve. The Presidents advisors told him the asserted
conflicts were meritless and had already been considered by the Department of
Justice.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsels Office was investigating
whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this a major
turning point in the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was
not under investigation, following Comeys firing, the President now was under
investigation. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the
Department of Justice and the Special Counsels investigation. On June 17, 2017, the
President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney
General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be
removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he
would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night
Massacre.

<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Two days after directing McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President
made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19,
2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign
manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and
dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said
that Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from
the Russia investigation, the investigation was very unfair to the President, the
President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special
Counsel and let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future
elections. Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to
do.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the
President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel
investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the
message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly
criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of
tweets making it clear that Sessionss job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to
deliver the Presidents message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick
Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not
follow through.

 id="x1-1680002"></a>Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.</h5>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >In the summer of 2017, the President learned that media outlets were asking questions
about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials,
including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was said to be offering damaging
information about Hillary Clinton as part of Russia and its governments support for
Mr.&#x00A0;Trump. On several occasions, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the
emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and
that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the
emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by
deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with an individual who
[Trump Jr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign and instead
said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children. When the
press asked questions about the Presidents involvement in Trump Jr.s statement,
the Presidents personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any
role.

<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >In early summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to
reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In
October 2017, the President met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked
him to take [a] look at investigating Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after
Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the President met
with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes taken by a
senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia
investigation, he would be a hero. The President told Sessions, Im not going to do
anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly. In response,
Sessions volunteered that he had never seen anything improper on the campaign and
told the President there was a whole new leadership team in place. He did not
unrecuse.

Counsel removed.</h5>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to have the
Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather
than carry out the order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White
House officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not
been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials
that the media reports were accurate in stating that the President had directed
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. The President then met with
McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports. In the same
meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special Counsel
about the Presidents effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took
notes of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from
what he remembered happening and perceived the President to be testing his
mettle.

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began
cooperating with the government, the Presidents personal counsel left a message for Flynns
attorneys reminding them of the Presidents warm feelings towards Flynn, which he said

President. When Flynns counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share information
pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the Presidents personal counsel said he
would make sure that the President knew that Flynns actions reflected hostility
towards the President. During Manaforts prosecution and when the jury in his
criminal, trial was deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that
Manafort was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After
Manafort was convicted, the President called Manafort a brave man for refusing
to break and said that flipping almost ought to be outlawed. ________ ___ _____________

 id="x1-1720002"></a>Conduct involving Michael Cohen.</h5>
<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >The Presidents conduct towards Michael Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive,
changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized the Presidents involvement in the
Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when he became a cooperating
witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the Trump
Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed
candidate Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether
Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided
false testimony to Congress about the project, including stating that he had only
briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed travel to Russia with
him, in an effort to adhere to a party line that Cohen said was developed to
minimize the Presidents connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional
testimony, Cohen had extensive discussions with the Presidents personal counsel, who,
according to Cohen, said that Cohen should stay on message and not contradict the
President. After the FBI searched Cohens home and office in April 2018, the
President publicly asserted that Cohen would not flip, contacted him directly to tell
him to stay strong, and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also
discussed pardons with the Presidents personal counsel and believed that if he
stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating
with the government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized
him, called him a rat, and suggested that his family members had committed
crimes.

evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the Presidents
conduct.
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical
obstruction-of-justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and
some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts
within his Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed below.
At the same time, the Presidents position as the head of the Executive Branch
provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings,
subordinate officers, and potential witnesses - all of which is relevant to a potential
obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in
obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that
the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election
interference. Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime,
the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of the Presidents intent and
requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third, many of the
Presidents acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the
government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That
circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the
reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence
witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice systems integrity is the
same.
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern
of the Presidents conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the
Presidents acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the
actions we investigated can be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in
the Presidents motives. The first phase covered the period from the Presidents
first interactions with Comey through the Presidents firing of Comey. During
that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally under
investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special
Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being
investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President
engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation,
non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage
witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about the nature of the
Presidents motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
evidence.

 id="x1-175000A."></a>Statutory defenses.</h5>
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justices general approach to
interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply
here. See 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span>1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is
an omnibus obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive
acts directed at pending or contemplated official proceedings. No principle of
statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision to cover only conduct that
impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505 also offer
broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, judicial,
administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a
provision in Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or
hinder the communication to law enforcement of information related to a federal
crime.

</p>
   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-176000A."></a>Constitutional defenses.</h5>
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >As for constitutional defenses arising from the Presidents status as the head of
the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the
courts have not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those
issues through the framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing
separation-of-powers issues. The Department of Justice and the Presidents personal counsel
have recognized that the President is subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of
justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct does not
implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the President can be
found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the
Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a Presidents corrupt
use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of
justice.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and
permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II
powers. The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official
proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts
regardless of their source. We also concluded that any inroad on presidential authority that

ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term corruptly sets a demanding
standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to
obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official
duty and the rights of others. A preclusion of corrupt official action does not
diminish the Presidents ability to exercise Article II powers. For example, the
proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President
to act with a corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment,
avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a
statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers,
rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It
also aligns with the Presidents constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.
Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of
the Presidents conduct is justified, inquiries to determine whether the President
acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance of his
constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction
laws to the Presidents corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our
constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the
law.

 id="x1-177000A."></a>Conclusion</h4>
<!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the Presidents conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
Presidents actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we
were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence
after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit
obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal
standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate
him.

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this
Office with jurisdiction to investigate federal crimes committed in the course of, and with
intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of
justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses. 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>600.4(a). Because
of that description of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice
investigation with the elements of obstruction offenses in mind. Our evidentiary
analysis is similarly focused on the elements of such offenses, although we do not
draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that govern a prosecutorial decision
under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>9-27.000 et
seq.&#x00A0;(2018).
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Here, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant
obstruction statutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the unique
constitutional issues that arise in an inquiry into official acts by the President. Those
issues are discussed in a later section of this report addressing constitutional
defenses that the Presidents counsel have raised. See Volume II, Section III.B,
infra.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Three basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: (1) an
obstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3)
a corrupt intent. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span>1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2). We describe those elements
as they have been interpreted by the courts. We then discuss a more specific statute aimed
at witness tampering, see 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1512(b), and describe the requirements
for attempted offenses and endeavors to obstruct justice, see 18 U.S.C. <span

<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Obstruction-of-justice law reaches all corrupt conduct capable of producing an effect that
prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means employed. United
States v.&#x00A0;Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir.&#x00A0;1984) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1503).
An effort to influence a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct justice even if the
effort was subtle or circuitous and however cleverly or with whatever cloaking of purpose it
was made. United States v.&#x00A0;Roe, 529 F.2d 629, 632 (4th Cir.&#x00A0;1975); see also United States
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
v.&#x00A0;Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir.&#x00A0;2006). The verbs obstruct or impede are
broad and can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders. Marinello
v.&#x00A0;United States, 138 S. Ct.&#x00A0;1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks
omitted).
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   An improper motive can render an actors conduct criminal even when the conduct
would otherwise be lawful and within the actors authority. See United States v.&#x00A0;Cueto, 151
F.3d 620, 631 (7th Cir.&#x00A0;1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense
attorney for litigation related conduct); United States v.&#x00A0;Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 992 (1st

 id="x1-181000A."></a>Nexus to a pending or contemplated official proceeding.</h5>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Obstruction-of-justice law generally requires a nexus, or connection, to an official
proceeding. In Section 1503, the nexus must be to pending judicial or grand jury
proceedings. United States v.&#x00A0;Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995). In Section 1505, the nexus
can include a connection to a pending federal agency proceeding or a congressional inquiry
or investigation. Under both statutes, the government must demonstrate a relationship in
time, causation, or logic between the obstructive act and the proceeding or inquiry to be
obstructed. Jd.&#x00A0;at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v.&#x00A0;United States, 544 U.S. 696,
707-708 (2005). Section 1512(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official proceedings
including judicial or grand jury proceedings. 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1515(a)(1)(A). For purposes of
Section 1512, an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted
at the time of the offense. 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1512(f)(1). Although a proceeding need
not already be in progress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to
a contemplated proceeding still must be shown. United States v.&#x00A0;Young, 916
F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir.&#x00A0;2019); United States v.&#x00A0;Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th
Cir.&#x00A0;2015); United States v.&#x00A0;Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir.&#x00A0;2009); United
States v.&#x00A0;Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.&#x00A0;2007). The nexus requirement narrows
the scope of obstruction statutes to ensure that individuals have fair warning
of what the law proscribes. Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks
omitted).
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   The nexus showing has subjective and objective components. As an objective matter, a
defendant must act in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice, such that the statute
excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally
and improbably be successful. Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (emphasis added; internal
quotation marks omitted). (T]he endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of
interfering with the due administration of justice. Jd.&#x00A0;at 599 (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). As a subjective matter, the actor must have contemplated a
particular, foreseeable proceeding. Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445-446. A defendant need not
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
directly impede the proceeding. Rather, a nexus exists if discretionary actions of a third
person would be required to obstruct the judicial proceeding if it was foreseeable to the
defendant that the third party would act on the [defendants] communication in such
a way as to obstruct the judicial proceeding. United States v.&#x00A0;Martinez, 862

The requisite showing is made when a person acted with an intent to obtain

<span

establish corrupt persuasion, it is sufficient that the defendant asked a potential
witness to lie to investigators in contemplation of a likely federal investigation
into his conduct. United States v.&#x00A0;Edlind, 887 F.3d 166, 174 (4th Cir.&#x00A0;2018);
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
United States v.&#x00A0;Sparks, 791 F.3d 1188, 1191-1192 (10th Cir.&#x00A0;2015); United States

The persuasion need not be coercive, intimidating, or explicit; it is sufficient to
urge, induce, ask[], argu[e], giv[e] reasons, Sparks, 791 F.3d at 1192, or coach[] or
remind[] witnesses by planting misleading facts, Edlind, 887 F.3d at 174. Corrupt
persuasion is shown where a defendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the
story were true, intending that the witness believe the story and testify to it.
United States v.&#x00A0;Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir.&#x00A0;1986); see United States
v.&#x00A0;Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir.&#x00A0;1997). It also covers urging a witness to
recall a fact that the witness did not know, even if the fact was actually true.
See LaShay, 417 F.3d at 719. Corrupt persuasion also can be shown in certain
circumstances when a person, with an improper motive, urges a witness not to cooperate
with law enforcement. See United States v.&#x00A0;Shotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th
Cr.&#x00A0;1998) (telling Secretary not to [say] anything [to the FBI] and [she] would not be

</p><!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   When the charge is acting with the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the
communication of information to law enforcement under Section 1512(b)(3), the nexus to a
proceeding inquiry articulated in Aguilar - that an individual have knowledge that his
actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding, 515 U.S. at 599 - does not apply because
the obstructive act is aimed at the communication of information to investigators, not at
impeding an official proceeding.

even if the defendant honestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful). It is an

<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Section 1512(c)(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses and attempts to obstruct
justice. Under general principles of attempt law, a person is guilty of an attempt when he
has the intent to commit a substantive offense and takes an overt act that constitutes a
substantial step towards that goal. See United States v.&#x00A0;Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102,
106-107 (2007). [T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the
defendants criminal purpose. United States v.&#x00A0;Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir.&#x00A0;2003).
While mere abstract talk does not suffice, any concrete and specific acts that corroborate

1184, 1198- 1205 (10th Cir.&#x00A0;2011). Thus, soliciting an innocent agent to engage in
conduct constituting an element of the crime may qualify as a substantial step.

1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir.&#x00A0;1988) (collecting cases). It is well established that a[n]
[obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete when one corruptly endeavors to obstruct or
impede the due administration of justice; the prosecution need not prove that
the due administration of justice was actually obstructed or impeded. United

the White Houses concurrence in our conducting interviews of White House personnel who
had relevant information. And we interviewed other witnesses who had pertinent

where appropriate. These investigative steps allowed us to gather a substantial amount of

agree to provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions

authority and legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the
Presidents testimony, we chose not to do so. We made that decision in view of the
substantial delay that such an investigative step would likely produce at a late

investigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence.
See, e.g., United States v.&#x00A0;Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir.&#x00A0;2016) ([G]uilty
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
knowledge can rarely be established by direct evidence.... Therefore, mens rea elements
such as knowledge or intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.) (internal quotation
marks omitted); United States v.&#x00A0;Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 36 (2d Cir.&#x00A0;2012) (The
governments case rested on circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of
knowledge and intent can often be proved through circumstantial evidence and the
reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.) (internal quotation marks omitted). The principle
that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence is a necessity in criminal cases,
given the right of a subject to assert his privilege against compelled self-incrimination
under the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to testify. Accordingly, determinations
on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an investigatory
subject.
</p><!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >   Obstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule. See, e.g., Edlind, 887 F.3d at
174, 176 (relying on significant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was
conscious of her wrongdoing in an obstruction case; [b]ecause evidence of intent will
almost always be circumstantial, a defendant may be found culpable where the
reasonable and foreseeable consequences of her acts are the obstruction of justice)
(internal quotation marks, ellipses, and punctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441
F.3d at 173-174. Circumstantial evidence that illuminates intent may include a
pattern of potentially obstructive acts. Fed.&#x00A0;R. Evid.&#x00A0;404(b) (Evidence of a crime,
wrong, or other act ... may be admissible ... [to] prov[e] motive, opportunity, intent,
preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.); see,
e.g., United States v.&#x00A0;Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648-650 (1st Cir.&#x00A0;1996); United
States v.&#x00A0;Arnold, 773 F.2d 823, 832-834 (7th Cir.&#x00A0;1985); Cintolo, 818 F.2d at
1000.
</p><!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >   Credibility judgments may also be made based on objective facts and circumstantial
evidence. Standard jury instructions highlight a variety of factors that are often
relevant in assessing credibility. These include whether a witness had a reason not to
tell the truth; whether the witness had a good memory; whether the witness
had the opportunity to observe the events about which he testified; whether the
witnesss testimony was corroborated by other witnesses; and whether anything the
witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony. See, e.g., First Circuit
Pattern Jury Instructions <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1.06 (2018); Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions
(Criminal Cases) <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>3.01
(2012).
</p><!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >   In addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in
assessing the credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts. For example, contemporaneous
written notes can provide strong corroborating evidence. See United States v.&#x00A0;Nobles, 422
U.S. 225, 232 (1975) (the fact that a statement appeared in the contemporaneously
recorded report . . . would tend strongly to corroborate the investigators version of the
interview). Similarly, a witnesss recitation of his account before he had any motive to
fabricate also supports the witnesss credibility. See Tome v.&#x00A0;United States, 513 U.S. 150,
158 (1995) (A consistent statement that predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
charge that the testimony was contrived as a consequence of that motive.). Finally, a
witnesss false description of an encounter can imply consciousness of wrongdoing. See
Al-Adahi v.&#x00A0;Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir.&#x00A0;2010) (noting the well-settled
principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence - often strong evidence - of guilt).
We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of our
investigation.

<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >This section of the report details the evidence we obtained. We first provide an
overview of how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how
candidate Trump responded. We then turn to the key events that we investigated:
the President&#8217;s conduct concerning the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the
President&#8217;s reaction to public confirmation of the FBI&#8217;s Russia investigation; events
leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Comey; efforts to
terminate the Special Counsel; efforts to curtail the scope of the Special Counsel&#8217;s
investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump
Tower meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials; efforts to have the
Attorney General unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other
witnesses.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   We summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three
statutory obstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding,
and intent. We focus on elements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel
has &#8220;jurisdiction &#x2026;to investigate &#x2026;federal crimes committed in the course of, and
with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation, such as perjury,
obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.&#8221; 28
C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>600.4(a). Consistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal obstruction
crimes, we gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of those crimes and
analyzed them within an elements framework&#8211;while refraining from reaching ultimate
conclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above.
This section also does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by
counsel for the President; those defenses are analyzed in Volume II, Section III,

The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party
emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump responded to questions
about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement in Russia&#8211;even
though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late as June
2016. Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same time
as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information about any further planned
WikiLeaks releases. After the election, when questions persisted about possible
links between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to

<!--l. 563--><p class="noindent" >The next day, January 27, 2017, McGahn and Eisenberg discussed the results of
Eisenberg&#8217;s initial legal research into Flynn&#8217;s conduct, and specifically whether
Flynn may have violated the Espionage Act, the Logan Act, or 18 U.S.C.

Based on his preliminary research, Eisenberg informed McGahn that there
was a possibility that Flynn had violated 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1001 and the Logan
Act.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn161x2" id="fn161x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">161</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-197002f161"></a>
Eisenberg noted that the United States had never successfully prosecuted an individual
under the Logan Act and that Flynn could have possible defenses, and told McGahn that
he believed it was unlikely that a prosecutor would pursue a Logan Act charge under the
circumstances.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-197004f163"></a>
In that second meeting, McGahn expressed doubts that the Department of Justice would
bring a Logan Act prosecution against Flynn, but stated that the White House did not
want to take action that would interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation of
Flynn.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn164x2" id="fn164x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">164</sup></a></span><a

Priebus recalled that before the dinner, he told the President something like, &#8221;don&#8217;t talk about
Russia, whatever you do,&#8221; and the President promised he would not talk about Russia at the
dinner.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

McGahn had previously advised the President that he should not communicate directly with
the Department of Justice to avoid the perception or reality of political interference in law
enforcement.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn169x2" id="fn169x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">169</sup></a></span><a

When Bannon learned about the President&#8217;s planned dinner with Comey, he suggested that
he or Priebus also attend, but the President stated that he wanted to dine with Comey
alone.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Comey said that when he arrived for the dinner that evening, he
was surprised and concerned to see that no one else had been
invited.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >   Comey provided an account of the dinner in a contemporaneous memo, an interview with
this Office, and congressional testimony. According to Comey&#8217;s account of the dinner, the
President repeatedly brought up Comey&#8217;s future, asking whether he wanted to stay on as FBI
director.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn172x2" id="fn172x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">172</sup></a></span><a

Because the President had previously said he wanted Comey to stay
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
on as FBI director, Comey interpreted the President&#8217;s comments as an
effort to create a patronage relationship by having Comey ask for his
job.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-197014f173"></a>
The President also brought up the Steele reporting that Comey had
raised in the January 6, 2017 briefing and stated that he was thinking
about ordering the FBI to investigate the allegations to prove they were
false.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn174x2" id="fn174x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">174</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-197015f174"></a>
Comey responded that the President should think carefully about issuing such an order
because it could create a narrative that the FBI was investigating him personally, which was
incorrect.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Comey did not respond and the conversation moved on to other topics, but the President
returned to the subject of Comey&#8217;s job at the end of the dinner and repeated, &#8221;I need
loyalty.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 644--><p class="indent" >   After Comey&#8217;s account of the dinner became public, the
President and his advisors disputed that he had asked for Comey&#8217;s
loyalty.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn183x2" id="fn183x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">183</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-197024f183"></a>
The President also indicated that he had not invited Comey to dinner, telling a reporter
that he thought Comey had &#8221;asked for the dinner&#8221; because &#8221;he wanted to stay
on.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

But substantial evidence corroborates Comey&#8217;s account of the dinner

shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly opened the door during the

</p><!--l. 1017--><p class="indent" >   Fourth, the President&#8217;s decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the
Attorney General from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with
Comey, which is consistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Comey recalls,
rather than a more innocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the
Attorney General.
</p><!--l. 1019--><p class="indent" >   Finally, Comey&#8217;s reaction to the President&#8217;s statements is consistent with the President
having asked him to &#8221;let[] Flynn go.&#8221; Comey met with the FBI leadership team, which
agreed to keep the President&#8217;s statements closely held and not to inform the team working
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
on the Flynn investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President&#8217;s request.
Comey also promptly met with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left
alone with the President again, an account verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff
James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney General&#8217;s chief of
staff.
</p><!--l. 1023--><p class="indent" >   A second question is whether the President&#8217;s statements, which were not phrased as a
direct order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI&#8217;s investigation of Flynn.
While the President said he &#8221;hope[d]&#8221; Comey could &#8221;let[] Flynn go,&#8221; rather than
affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the
President was asking Comey to close the FBI&#8217;s investigation into Flynn. First, the
President arranged the meeting with Comey sot hat they would be alone and purposely
excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the President meant to make a
request to Comey that he did not want anyone else to hear. Second, because the
President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he &#8221;hopes&#8221; a
subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will
do what the President wants. Indeed, the President repeated a version of &#8221;let
this go&#8221; three times, and Comey testified that he understood the President&#8217;s
statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the way Comey reacted at the
time.
</p><!--l. 1029--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to a proceeding.</span> To establish a nexus to a proceeding, it would be necessary
to show that the President could reasonably foresee and actually contemplated
that the investigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or
prosecution.
</p><!--l. 1032--><p class="indent" >   At the time of the President&#8217;s one-on-one meeting with Comey, no grand jury
subpoenas had been issued as part of the FBI&#8217;s investigation into Flynn. But Flynn&#8217;s lies to
the FBI violated federal criminal law, ________ ___ _____________ _________, and resulted in Flynn&#8217;s
prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1001. By the time the President spoke to Comey about
Flynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who informed the President, that Flynn&#8217;s
statements to senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true
and that Flynn had told the same version of events to the FBI. McGahn also informed the
President that Flynn&#8217;s conduct could violate 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1001. After the Vice President and
senior White House officials reviewed the underlying information about Flynn&#8217;s
calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that Flynn could not have forgotten his
conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been lying. In addition,
the President&#8217;s instruction to the FBI Director to &#8221;let[] Flynn go&#8221; suggests his
awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of
prosecution.
</p><!--l. 1039--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a personal
stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn - for example, whether the President
was aware of Flynn&#8217;s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred,
such that the President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that
those lies had been passed on to the public. Some evidence suggests that the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
President knew about the existence and content of Flynn&#8217;s calls when they occurred,
but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be relied upon to establish the
President&#8217;s knowledge. In advance of Flynn&#8217;s initial call with Kislyak, the President
attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have
mentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland
about the substance of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a
difference in Russia&#8217;s response, and Flynn recalled talking to Bannon in early January
2017 about how they had successfully &#8221;stopped the train on Russia&#8217;s response&#8221;
to the sanctions. It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have wanted the
President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn
his request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia
had chosen not to retaliate in response to the request, and the President was
pleased by the Russian response, calling it a &#8221;[g]reat move.&#8221; And the President
never said publicly or internally that Flynn had lied to him about the calls with
Kislyak.
</p><!--l. 1047--><p class="indent" >   But McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn&#8217;s read-out of his
calls with Kislyak, and Flynn does not have a specific recollection of telling the
President-Elect directly about the calls. Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about
the calls from Flynn. And in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed
on the calls and whether he had lied to the Vice President, suggesting that he did not
already know. Our investigation accordingly did not produce evidence that established that
the President knew about Flynn&#8217;s discussions of sanctions before the Department of Justice
notified the White House of those discussions in late January 2017. The evidence also does
not establish that Flynn otherwise possessed information damaging to the President that
would give the President a personal incentive to end the FBI&#8217;s inquiry into Flynn&#8217;s
conduct.
</p><!--l. 1053--><p class="indent" >   Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the
FBI&#8217;s broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that
terminating Flynn would end &#8221;the whole Russia thing.&#8221; Flynn&#8217;s firing occurred
at a time when the media and Congress were raising questions about Russia&#8217;s
interference in the election and whether members of the President&#8217;s campaign
had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President viewed
the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election. The
President paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with
annoyance and anger when the story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed
sanctions with Kislyak. Just hours before meeting one-on-one with Comey, the
President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to the Russia inquiries.
And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would
not end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to
Comey and convey that the President liked him and he was part of &#8221;the team.&#8221;
That afternoon, the President cleared the room and asked Comey to &#8221;let[] Flynn
go.&#8221;
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 1061--><p class="indent" >   We also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President&#8217;s direction to
Comey was motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the
President repeatedly described Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the
Russia investigation, and the President directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to
tell him the President &#8221;care[d]&#8221; about him and felt bad for him. At the same
time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, Priebus, and Hicks, said that
the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was forced to
resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he
believed the President&#8217;s initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal
regard, but from concern about the negative press that would be generated by
firing the National Security Advisor so early in the Administration. And Priebus
indicated that the President&#8217;s post-firing expressions of support for Flynn were
motivated by the President&#8217;s desire to keep Flynn from saying negative things about
him.
</p><!--l. 1067--><p class="indent" >   The way in which the President communicated the request to Comey also is relevant to
understanding the President&#8217;s intent. When the President first learned about the FBI
investigation into Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter
with anyone else in the White House. The next day, the President invited Comey for a
one-on-one dinner against the advice of an aide who recommended that other White House
officials also attend. At the dinner, the President asked Comey for &#8221;loyalty&#8221; and, at a
different point in the conversation, mentioned that Flynn had judgment issues. When the
President met with Comey the day after Flynn&#8217;s termination - shortly after being told by
Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia investigation - the President
cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he could again
speak to Comey alone. The President&#8217;s decision to meet one-on-one with Comey
contravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not
communicate directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of
interfering in law enforcement activities. And the President later denied that he
cleared the room and asked Comey to &#8221;let[] Flynn go&#8221; - a denial that would have
been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise of prosecutorial
discretion.
</p><!--l. 1075--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President&#8217;s effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that
the President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the
President&#8217;s concern about being associated with Flynn&#8217;s conduct. The evidence does not
establish that the President was trying to have McFarland lie. The President&#8217;s
request, however, was sufficiently irregular that McFarland - who did not know
the full extent of Flynn&#8217;s communications with the President and thus could
not make the representation the President wanted - felt the need to draft an
internal memorandum documenting the President&#8217;s request, and Eisenberg was
concerned that the request would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an
ambassadorship.

On March 1, 2017, the press reported that, in his January confirmation hearing to become
Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian
Ambassador Kislyak before the presidential election, leading to congressional calls for Sessions
to recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia&#8217;s interference in the presidential

According to an email Comey sent to his chief of staff after the call, the President &#8221;talked

Comey interpreted the call as an effort by the President to &#8221;pull [him] in,&#8221; but he did not perceive
the call as an attempt by the President to find out what Comey was doing with the Flynn

McGahn understood the President to be concerned that a recusal would make
Sessions look guilty for omitting details in his confirmation hearing; leave the

According to Comey&#8217;s contemporaneous record of the conversation, the President said &#8221;he
was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that

The President asked Comey what could be done to &#8221;lift the
cloud.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn362x2" id="fn362x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">362</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206003f362"></a>
Comey explained &#8221;that we were running it down as quickly as possible and that there would be great
benefit, if we didn&#8217;t find anything, to our Good Housekeeping seal of approval, but we had to do our
work.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn363x2" id="fn363x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">363</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206004f363"></a> Comey also
told the President that congressional leaders were aware that the FBI was not investigating the President
personally.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The President commented that if there was &#8221;some satellite&#8221; (which Comey took to
mean an associate of the President&#8217;s or the campaign) that did something, &#8221;it
would be good to find that out&#8221; but that he himself had not done anything wrong
and he hoped Comey &#8221;would find a way to get out that we weren&#8217;t investigating
him.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-206007f366"></a> After
the call ended, Comey called Boente and told him about the conversation, asked for guidance on
how to respond, and said he was uncomfortable with direct contact from the President about the
investigation.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-206009f368"></a>
According to Comey&#8217;s contemporaneous record of the conversation, the
President said he was &#8221;following up to see if [Comey] did what [the
President] had asked last time - getting out that he personally is not under
investigation.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn369x2" id="fn369x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">369</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206010f369"></a>
Comey responded that he had passed the request to Boente but not heard
back, and he informed the President that the traditional channel for
such a request would be to have the White House Counsel contact DOJ
leadership.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn370x2" id="fn370x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">370</sup></a></span><a

you know.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-206013f372"></a>
In a televised interview that was taped early that afternoon, the President was asked if it was
too late for him to ask Comey to step down; the President responded, &#8221;No, it&#8217;s not too late,
but you know, I have confidence in him. We&#8217;ll see what happens. You know, it&#8217;s going to be
interesting.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-206014f373"></a>
After the interview, Hicks told the President she thought the President&#8217;s
comment about Comey should be removed from the broadcast of the
interview, but the President wanted to keep it in, which Hicks thought was
unusual.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 1438--><p class="indent" >   Later that day, the President told senior advisors, including McGahn
and Priebus, that he had reached out to Comey twice in recent
weeks.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-206016f375"></a>
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
The President acknowledged that McGahn would not approve of the outreach to Comey
because McGahn had previously cautioned the President that he should not talk to Comey
directly to prevent any perception that the White House was interfering with
investigations.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn376x2" id="fn376x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">376</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206017f376"></a>
The President told McGahn that Comey had indicated the FBI could make a public statement
that the President was not under investigation if the Department of Justice approved that
action.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn377x2" id="fn377x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">377</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206018f377"></a>
After speaking with the President, McGahn followed up with Boente to relay the President&#8217;s
understanding that the FBI could make a public announcement if the Department of Justice
cleared it.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn378x2" id="fn378x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">378</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206019f378"></a>
McGahn recalled that Boente said Comey had told him there was nothing
obstructive about the calls from the President, but they made Comey
uncomfortable.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn379x2" id="fn379x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">379</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206020f379"></a>
According to McGahn, Boente responded that he did not want to issue a statement about the
President not being under investigation because of the potential political ramifications and did
not want to order Comey to do it because that action could prompt the appointment of a Special
Counsel.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn380x2" id="fn380x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">380</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-206021f380"></a>
Boente did not recall that aspect of his conversation with McGahn, but did recall
telling McGahn that the direct outreaches from the President to Comey were a
problem.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 1467--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s reaction to Sessions&#8217;s recusal and the requests he made to
Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of
obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 1469--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The evidence shows that, after Comey&#8217;s March 20, 2017 testimony,
the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss
the FBI&#8217;s investigation. But witnesses had different recollections of the precise
content of those outreaches. Some ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them
immediately after the March 22 Oval Office meeting that the President asked
Coats to intervene with Comey and &#8221;stop&#8221; the investigation. But the first-hand
witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had
no memory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging
officials to get the word out that the President had not done anything wrong
related to Russia. Coats recalled that the President asked that Coats state publicly
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
that no link existed between the President and Russia, but did not ask him to
speak with Comey or to help end the investigation. The other outreaches by the
President during this period were similar in nature. The President asked Rogers if he
could do anything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the
President asked Comey to make a public statement that would &#8221;lift the cloud&#8221; of the
ongoing investigation by making clear that the President was not personally under
investigation. These requests, while significant enough that Rogers thought it
important to document the encounter in a written memorandum, were not interpreted
by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1481--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to a proceeding.</span> At the time of the President&#8217;s outreaches to leaders of the
intelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI&#8217;s Russia investigation did
not yet involve grand jury proceedings. The outreaches, however, came after and were in
response to Comey&#8217;s March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its
counterintelligence mission, was conducting an investigation into Russian interference in
the 2016 presidential election. Comey testified that the investigation included any links or
coordination with Trump campaign officials and would &#8221;include an assessment of whether
any crimes were committed.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 1486--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked or
directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI&#8217;s Russia investigation
- and the President affirmatively told Comey that if &#8221;some satellite&#8221; was involved in
Russian election interference &#8221;it would be good to find that out.&#8221; But the President&#8217;s
intent in trying to prevent Sessions&#8217;s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo,
Rogers, and Comey following Comey&#8217;s public announcement of the FBI&#8217;s Russia
investigation, is nevertheless relevant to understanding what motivated the President&#8217;s
other actions towards the investigation.
</p><!--l. 1490--><p class="indent" >   The evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation&#8217;s
implications for his presidency - and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he
was under investigation or had links to Russia. In early March, the President
attempted to prevent Sessions&#8217;s recusal, even after being told that Sessions was
following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After Sessions recused, the White House
Counsel&#8217;s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions about the matter,
although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The
President continued to raise the issue of Sessions&#8217;s recusal and, when he had the
opportunity, he pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse. The President also told
advisors that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him, the way he
perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents.
The President made statements about being able to direct the course of criminal
investigations, saying words to the effect of, &#8221;You&#8217;re telling me that Bobby and
Jack didn&#8217;t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn&#8217;t tell Eric Holder who to
investigate?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 1498--><p class="indent" >   After Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the FBI&#8217;s Russia investigation on
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
March 20, 2017, the President was &#8221;beside himself&#8217; and expressed anger that Comey did
not issue a statement correcting any misperception that the President himself was
under investigation. The President sought to speak with Acting Attorney General
Boente directly and told McGahn to contact Boente to request that Comey make
a clarifying statement. The President then asked other intelligence community
leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the President had
links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the
investigation. On March 30 and April 11, against the advice of White House
advisors who had informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be
perceived as improper interference in an ongoing investigation, the President
made personal outreaches to Comey asking him to &#8221;lift the cloud&#8221; of the Russia
investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally under
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1503--><p class="indent" >   Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia
investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was
not true based on Comey&#8217;s representations. The President complained to advisors that if
people thought Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had
accomplished.
</p><!--l. 1506--><p class="indent" >   Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the
Russia investigation on his ability to govern. The President complained that the
perception that he was under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct
foreign relations, particularly with Russia. The President told Coats he &#8221;can&#8217;t do
anything with Russia,&#8221; he told Rogers that &#8221;the thing with the Russians&#8221; was
interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Comey that &#8221;he was
trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that
difficult.&#8221;

testimony, the President continued to tell advisors that he wanted Comey to make
public that the President was not under investigation. At the hearing, Comey
declined to answer questions about the scope or subjects of the Russia investigation
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
and did not state publicly that the President was not under investigation. Two
days later, on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was going to fire
Comey, and on May 9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make
public that Comey had on three occasions informed the President that he was
not under investigation. The President decided to fire Comey before receiving
advice or a recommendation from the Department of Justice, but he approved an
initial public account of the termination that attributed it to a recommendation
from the Department of Justice based on Comey&#8217;s handling of the Clinton email
investigation. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the
firing to his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire
Comey regardless of the DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia
investigation when he made the decision. The President also told the Russian
Foreign Minister, &#8221;I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut
job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That&#8217;s taken off..... I&#8217;m not under
investigation.&#8221;

At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about the status of the Russia investigation,

According to notes written by Hunt, the President said, &#8221;This is terrible

That evening and the next morning, White House officials and spokespeople

The media subsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President
brought up his decision the prior day to terminate Comey, telling Lavrov and
Kislyak: &#8221;I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I
faced great pressure because of Russia. That&#8217;s taken off.... I&#8217;m not under

The President never denied making those statements, and the White House did not
dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: &#8221;By grandstanding
and politicizing the investigation into Russia&#8217;s actions, James Comey created
unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The
investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of
Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national
security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified

When McGahn asked the President about his comments to Lavrov, the President
said it was good that Comey was fired because that took the pressure off by
making it clear that he was not under investigation so he could get more work
done.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

According to a memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the

The President also told McCabe that Comey should not have been permitted to travel

When McCabe met with the President that afternoon, the President, without prompting,
told McCabe that people in the FBI loved the President, estimated that at least 80% of the
FBI had voted for him, and asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 presidential

</p><!--l. 1879--><p class="indent" >   In the afternoon of May 10, 2017, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to the

 id="x1-209076f478"></a>
Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department of Justice, and bipartisan
members of Congress had lost confidence in Comey, &#8221;[a]nd most importantly, the rank and
file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director. Accordingly, the President accepted the
recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his
position.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-209077f479"></a>
In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided &#8221;on his own&#8221;
to review Comey&#8217;s performance and that Rosenstein decided &#8221;on his own&#8221; to come to the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter
indicated that the &#8221;vast majority&#8221; of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said,
&#8221;Look, we&#8217;ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different
things.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-209080f482"></a>
She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had
lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made &#8221;in the heat of the moment&#8221; that was not founded
on anything.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

attorneys in advance of the interview that the communications team could

 id="x1-209085f487"></a>
During the interview, the President stated that he had made the decision to fire Comey before
the President met with Rosenstein and Sessions. The President told Holt, &#8221;I was going to
fire regardless of recommendation .... [Rosenstein] made a recommendation. But regardless
of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do

The President continued, &#8221;And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself - I
said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.
It&#8217;s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should&#8217;ve

The President added that he realized his termination of Comey &#8221;probably maybe will confuse
people&#8221; with the result that it &#8221;might even lengthen out the investigation,&#8221; but he &#8221;ha[d]

<!--l. 1939--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s decision to fire Comey, the following evidence is relevant to
the elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 1941--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The act of firing Comey removed the individual overseeing the FBI&#8217;s
Russia investigation. The President knew that Comey was personally involved in the
investigation based on Comey&#8217;s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Comey&#8217;s March 20, 2017
public testimony about the investigation, and the President&#8217;s one-on-one conversations
with Comey.
</p><!--l. 1945--><p class="indent" >   Firing Comey would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable
effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation - for example, if the termination
would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the
President with the opportunity to appoint a director who would take a different
approach to the investigation that the President perceived as more protective of his
personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whether
the President&#8217;s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director or
other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The
President fired Comey abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign,
banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
&#8221;showboat&#8221; and claiming that the FBI was &#8221;in turmoil&#8221; under his leadership. And the
President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical
of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Comey, the President
referred to the investigation as a &#8221;witch hunt&#8221; and asked, &#8221;when does it end?&#8221;
Those actions had the potential to affect a successor director&#8217;s conduct of the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1952--><p class="indent" >   The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be
to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI
investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the
FBI director. Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he
could fire the FBI director, but could not fire the FBI. The White House issued
a press statement the day after Comey was fired that said, &#8221;The investigation
would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would
not have ended it.&#8221; In addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the
President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Comey that
the action might prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to
serve as interim director, even though McCabe told the President he had worked
&#8221;very closely&#8221; with Comey and was part of all the decisions made in the Clinton
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1959--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to a proceeding.</span> The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing that
a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was
objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated
Comey.
</p><!--l. 1962--><p class="indent" >   Several facts would be relevant to such as showing. At the time the President fired
Comey, a grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation
and no grand jury subpoenas had been issued. On March 20, 2017, however, Comey had
announced that the FBI was investigating Russia&#8217;s interference in the election, including
&#8221;an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.&#8221; It was widely known that the FBI,
as part of the Russia investigation, was investigating the hacking of the DNC&#8217;s computers -
a clear criminal offense.
</p><!--l. 1967--><p class="indent" >   In addition, at the time the President fired Comey, evidence indicates the President
knew that Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted,
despite the President&#8217;s February 14, 2017 request that Comey &#8221;let[] Flynn go.&#8221; On March
5, 2017, the White House Counsel&#8217;s Office was informed that the FBI was asking for
transition-period records relating to Flynn - indicating that the FBI was still actively
investigating him. The same day, the President told advisors he wanted to call Dana
Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, to find out whether
the White House or the President was being investigated. On March 31, 2017, the
President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by tweeting that
&#8221;Mike Flynn should ask for immunity&#8221; before he agreed to provide testimony to the FBI or
Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a
message to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
stay strong, further demonstrating the President&#8217;s awareness of Flynn&#8217;s criminal
exposure.
</p><!--l. 1973--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President&#8217;s decision to
fire Comey was Comey&#8217;s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not
personally under investigation, despite the President&#8217;s repeated requests that Comey make
such an announcement. In the week leading up to Comey&#8217;s May 3, 2017 Senate
Judiciary Committee testimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last
straw if Comey did not set the record straight and publicly announce that the
President was not under investigation. But during his May 3 testimony, Comey
refused to answer questions about whether the President was being investigated.
Comey&#8217;s refusal angered the President, who criticized Sessions for leaving him
isolated and exposed, saying &#8221;You left me on an island.&#8221; Two days later, the
President told advisors he had decided to fire Comey and dictated a letter to
Stephen Miller that began with a reference to the fact that the President was not
being investigated: &#8221;While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not
under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a
Trump-Russia relationship....&#8221; The President later asked Rosenstein to include &#8221;Russia&#8221; in
his memorandum and to say that Comey had told the President that he was
not under investigation. And the President&#8217;s final termination letter included a
sentence, at the President&#8217;s insistence and against McGahn&#8217;s advice, stating that
Comey had told the President on three separate occasions that he was not under
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1983--><p class="indent" >   The President&#8217;s other stated rationales for why he fired Comey are not similarly
supported by the evidence. The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller
prepared in Bedminster cited Comey&#8217;s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the
President told McCabe he fired Comey for that reason. But the facts surrounding Comey&#8217;s
handling of the Clinton email investigation were well known to the President at the
time he assumed office, and the President had made it clear to both Comey and
the President&#8217;s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted Comey to stay on as
director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Comey&#8217;s handling of the Clinton
investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey. The President&#8217;s
draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time
low and Sanders told the press after Comey&#8217;s termination that the White House
had heard from &#8221;countless&#8221; FBI agents who had lost confidence in Comey. But
the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Comey at their
January 27 dinner that &#8221;the people of the FBI really like [him],&#8221; no evidence
suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and
Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on
anything.
</p><!--l. 1991--><p class="indent" >   We also considered why it was important to the President that Comey announce
publicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President
believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President
told Comey that the &#8221;cloud&#8221; of &#8221;this Russia business&#8221; was making it difficult to run the
country. The President told Sessions and McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed
sympathy to him for being under investigation and that the perception he was under
investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. The President
complained to Rogers that &#8221;the thing with the Russians [was] messing up&#8221; his ability to
get things done with Russia, and told Coats, &#8221;I can&#8217;t do anything with Russia,
there&#8217;s things I&#8217;d like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they&#8217;re all over me
with this.&#8221; The President also may have viewed Comey as insubordinate for his
failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that the President was not under
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1999--><p class="indent" >   Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself
from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI&#8217;s
interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Comey, against the
advice of senior aides, and told Comey he needed Comey&#8217;s &#8221;loyalty.&#8221; When the
President later asked Comey for a second time to make public that he was not under
investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying &#8221;Because I have been very loyal
to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.&#8221; After the President learned
of Sessions&#8217;s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious
and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he
perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The
President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General &#8221;who to
investigate.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 2005--><p class="indent" >   In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI&#8217;s Russia investigation behind
him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover
up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the
evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close
to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure
conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any
Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation
would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the
President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and
political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the
election that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through
Michael Cohen, was pursuing the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project through
June 2016 and candidate Trump was repeatedly briefed on the progress of those
efforts.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn498x2" id="fn498x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">498</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-209096f498"></a>
In addition, some witnesses said that Trump was aware that ________ ___ _____________ _________ at a
time when public reports stated that Russian intelligence officials were behind the
hacks, and that Trump privately sought information about future WikiLeaks
releases.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn499x2" id="fn499x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">499</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-209097f499"></a>
More broadly, multiple witnesses described the President&#8217;s preoccupation with press coverage of the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Russia investigation and his persistent concern that it raised questions about the legitimacy of his
election.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn500x2" id="fn500x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">500</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-209098f500"></a>
</p><!--l. 2020--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President and White House aides initially advanced a pretextual reason to
the press and the public for Comey&#8217;s termination. In the immediate aftermath of the firing,
the President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the
DOJ recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But
the President had decided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those
recommendations. Although the President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to
fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice&#8217;s recommendations, he did so only
after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would resist the White House&#8217;s
suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey&#8217;s termination. The
initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the
President had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although
the evidence does not resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or
both.

prompting the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that
Attorney General Sessions had failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions
submitted his resignation, which the President ultimately did not accept. The
President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest, but
they responded that those claims were &#8221;ridiculous&#8221; and posed no obstacle to the
Special Counsel&#8217;s service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the
Special Counsel&#8217;s service. On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President
was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice and the President
responded with a series of tweets criticizing the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation. That
weekend, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special
Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest. McGahn did not carry
out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday Night
Massacre and instead prepared to resign. McGahn ultimately did not quit and the
President did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel
removed.

McGahn advised that the President could discuss the issue with his personal
attorney but it would &#8221;look like still trying to meddle in [the] investigation&#8221; and

McGahn told the President that his &#8221;biggest exposure&#8221; was not his act
of firing Comey but his &#8221;other contacts&#8221; and &#8221;calls,&#8221; and his &#8221;ask re:

&#8221;a major turning point&#8221; in the investigation; and that while &#8221;Trump had received private
assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not
personally under investigation,&#8221; &#8221;[o]fficials say that changed shortly after Comey&#8217;s

<!--l. 2385--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed,
the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 2387--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> As with the President&#8217;s firing of Comey, the attempt to remove the
Special Counsel would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the
investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.
Even if the removal of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation
from continuing under a new appointee, a fact finder would need to consider
whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the investigation,
chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 2391--><p class="indent" >   A threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahn to have the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Special Counsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017
the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the
President publicly disputed these accounts, and privately told McGahn that he
had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the Department of
Justice&#8217;s attention. See Volume II, Section III, infra. Some of the President&#8217;s specific
language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation.
Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went
further and in fact directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel
removed.
</p><!--l. 2398--><p class="indent" >   First, McGahn&#8217;s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell
Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that &#8221;Mueller has to go.&#8221; McGahn is a
credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White
House.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn601x2" id="fn601x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">601</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-213041f601"></a>
McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both
times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President&#8217;s request. In
response to that request, McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in
events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer,
drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with
his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President had asked him to &#8221;do crazy shit,&#8221;
and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those acts would be a
highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of
Justice.
</p><!--l. 2407--><p class="indent" >   Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the President, through his counsel, had
already brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice.
Accordingly, the President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to
raise conflicts issues that already had been raised.
</p><!--l. 2410--><p class="indent" >   Third, the President&#8217;s sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take
immediate action on a weekend - &#8221;You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.&#8221; - support
McGahn&#8217;s recollection that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action
to remove the Special Counsel. Had the President instead sought only to have the
Department of Justice re-examine asserted conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an
ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the process in motion on a Saturday and
to make repeated calls to McGahn.
</p><!--l. 2415--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President had discussed &#8221;knocking out Mueller&#8221; and raised conflicts of
interest in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the
conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17,
2017, the President made clear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the
President was considering terminating the Special Counsel. Also during this time period,
the President reached out to Christie to get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This
evidence shows that the President was not just seeking an examination of whether conflicts
existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a way to terminate the Special
Counsel.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 2420--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would be
necessary to establish a nexus between the President&#8217;s act of seeking to terminate the
Special Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding.
</p><!--l. 2423--><p class="indent" >   Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct
was under investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of
federal crimes to a grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the
President that his &#8221;biggest exposure&#8221; was not his act of firing Comey but his
&#8221;other contacts&#8221; and &#8221;calls,&#8221; and his &#8221;ask re: Flynn.&#8221; By early June, it was widely
reported in the media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas
in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn
investigation.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn602x2" id="fn602x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">602</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-213042f602"></a>
On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office informed the White House that investigators
would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by the
President to push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017, news outlets
began reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice.
Based on widespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could
include his request for Comey&#8217;s loyalty; his request that Comey &#8221;let[] Flynn go&#8221;; his
outreach to Coats and Rogers; and his termination of Comey and statement to
the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had relieved &#8221;great pressure&#8221;
related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed McGahn to
have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his
conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, &#8221;I am being
investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI
Director!&#8221;
</p><!--l. 2436--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that the President&#8217;s attempts to remove the
Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel&#8217;s oversight of investigations that
involved the President&#8217;s conduct - and, most immediately, to reports that the President was
being investigated for potential obstruction of justice.
</p><!--l. 2439--><p class="indent" >   Before the President terminated Comey, the President considered it critically important
that he was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being
investigated. As described in Volume II, Section II.D, supra, advisors perceived the
President, while he was drafting the Comey termination letter, to be concerned more than
anything else about getting out that he was not personally under investigation. When the
President learned of the appointment of the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed
further concern about the investigation, saying &#8221;[t]his is the end of my Presidency.&#8221; The
President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying &#8221;you were supposed to protect
me.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 2444--><p class="indent" >   On June 14, 2017, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was
investigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had
wanted to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of
widespread media attention. The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction
investigation prompted the President to call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
removed. By mid-June, the Department of Justice had already cleared the Special
Counsel&#8217;s service and the President&#8217;s advisors had told him that the claimed conflicts of
interest were &#8221;silly&#8221; and did not provide a basis to remove the Special Counsel. On June
13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good cause
for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press
statement to Sanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel. But
the next day, the media reported that the President was under investigation for
obstruction of justice and the Special Counsel was interviewing witnesses about
events related to possible obstruction - spurring the President to write critical
tweets about the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation. The President called McGahn
at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David. The
evidence accordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been
opened is what led the President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel
terminated.
</p><!--l. 2452--><p class="indent" >   There also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls
to McGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told
the President that the White House Counsel&#8217;s Office - and McGahn himself - could not be
involved in pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal
counsel if he wished to raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to
submit the conflicts claims, the President sought to use his official powers to
remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on the President&#8217;s
actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel
terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in
Volume II, Section III, infra. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and
suggest the President&#8217;s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as
improper.

President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June
19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and

effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only. One month
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
later, the President met again with Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have
Sessions limit the scope of the Russia investigation. Lewandowski told the President the
message would be delivered soon. Hours later, the President publicly criticized
Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about Sessions&#8217;s job
security.

<!--l. 2572--><p class="noindent" >Within hours of the President&#8217;s meeting with Lewandowski on July

before the job, I would have said, &#8217;Thanks, Jeff, but I can&#8217;t, you know, I&#8217;m

Later that morning, while aboard Marine One on the way to Norfolk,

Although the President tied his desire for Sessions to resign to Sessions&#8217;s negative press and
poor performance in congressional testimony, Priebus believed that the President&#8217;s desire to
replace Sessions was driven by the President&#8217;s hatred of Sessions&#8217;s recusal from the Russia

</p><!--l. 2684--><p class="indent" >   The President sought to have Sessions announce that the President &#8221;shouldn&#8217;t have a
Special Prosecutor/Counsel&#8221; and that Sessions was going to &#8221;meet with the Special
Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with
investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in
future elections.&#8221; The President wanted Sessions to disregard his recusal from the
investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ ethics review, and have
Sessions declare that he knew &#8221;for a fact&#8221; that &#8221;there were no Russians involved
with the campaign&#8221; because he &#8221;was there.&#8221; The President further directed that
Sessions should explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation
&#8221;because he hasn&#8217;t done anything wrong.&#8221; Taken together, the President&#8217;s directives
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
indicate that Sessions was being instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the
existing investigation into the President and his campaign, with the Special Counsel
being permitted to &#8221;move forward with investigating election meddling for future
elections.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 2689--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> As described above, by the time of the President&#8217;s
initial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand
jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. By the time of
the President&#8217;s follow-up meeting with Lewandowski, ________ ___ _____________ _________ See Volume
II, Section II.G, infra. To satisfy the nexus requirement, it would be necessary to show that
limiting the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation would have the natural and probable effect of
impeding that grand jury proceeding.
</p><!--l. 2695--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that the President&#8217;s effort to have Sessions limit
the scope of the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation to future election interference was intended
to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President&#8217;s and his campaign&#8217;s
conduct.
</p><!--l. 2698--><p class="indent" >   As previously described, see Volume II, Section II.B, supra, the President knew that the
Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of
Russian interference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election. The President
further knew that the investigation had broadened to include his own conduct
and whether he had obstructed justice. Those investigations would not proceed
if the Special Counsel&#8217;s jurisdiction were limited to future election interference
only.
</p><!--l. 2702--><p class="indent" >   The timing and circumstances of the President&#8217;s actions support the conclusion that he
sought that result. The President&#8217;s initial direction that Sessions should limit
the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation came just two days after the President had
ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, which itself followed public
reports that the President was personally under investigation for obstruction of
justice. The sequence of those events raises an inference that after seeking to
terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign&#8217;s
conduct from the investigation&#8217;s scope. The President raised the matter with
Lewandowski again on July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about
the June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials had
been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media coverage and investigative
interest.
</p><!--l. 2707--><p class="indent" >   The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent.
Rather than rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the
Oval Office. The President selected a loyal &#8221;devotee&#8221; outside the White House to deliver
the message, supporting an inference that he was working outside White House channels,
including McGahn, who had previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice
about the Special Counsel. The President also did not contact the Acting Attorney
General, who had just testified publicly that there was no cause to remove the Special
Counsel. Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and redirect the Special
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Counsel&#8217;s investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly take any action
on it.
</p><!--l. 2713--><p class="indent" >   The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President&#8217;s intent. The
President followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one
month after he first dictated the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still
sought to pursue the request. And just hours after Lewandowski assured the
President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the President gave
an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked
Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July
22, 2017, the President directed Priebus to obtain Sessions&#8217;s resignation. That
evidence could raise an inference that the President wanted Sessions to realize
that his job might be on the line as he evaluated whether to comply with the
President&#8217;s direction that Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal,
he was going to confine the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation to future election
interference.

<!--l. 2969--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s actions regarding the disclosure of information about the
June 9 meeting, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of
justice:
</p><!--l. 2971--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> On at least three occasions between June 29, 2017, and July 9, 2017,
the President directed Hicks and others not to publicly disclose information about the
June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney.
On June 29, Hicks warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9
meeting were &#8221;really bad&#8221; and the story would be &#8221;massive&#8221; when it broke, but the
President told her and Kushner to &#8221;leave it alone.&#8221; Early on July 8, after Hicks told
the President the New York Times was working on a story about the June 9
meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the
President usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.
Later that day, the President rejected Trump Jr.&#8217;s draft statement that would
have acknowledged that the meeting was with &#8221;an individual who I was told
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
might have information helpful to the campaign.&#8221; The President then dictated a
statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption (which
the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement
dictated by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about
Clinton.
</p><!--l. 2978--><p class="indent" >   Each of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was
directed at the press. They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by
taking these actions, sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional
investigators or the Special Counsel. On May 17, 2017, the President&#8217;s campaign received a
document request from SSCI that clearly covered the June 9 meeting and underlying
emails, and those documents also plainly would have been relevant to the Special Counsel&#8217;s
investigation.
</p><!--l. 2982--><p class="indent" >   But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails
or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the
Special Counsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to
the emails and prevent their public release occurred in the context of developing a press
strategy. The only evidence we have of the President discussing the production of
documents to Congress or the Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when
Hicks recalled the President acknowledging that Kushner&#8217;s attorney should provide emails
related to the June 9 meeting to whomever he needed to give them to. We do
not have evidence of what the President discussed with his own lawyers at that
time.
</p><!--l. 2987--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> As described above, by the time of the President&#8217;s
attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting,
the existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel
was public knowledge, and the President had been told that the emails were
responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the nexus requirement, however,
it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the emails to the
public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury
proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does not establish
that the President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official
proceedings.
</p><!--l. 2992--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> The evidence establishes the President&#8217;s substantial involvement in the
communications strategy related to information about his campaign&#8217;s connections to
Russia and his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The
President became aware of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them
with Hicks and Kushner, and he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017,
when lawyers for the Trump Organization began interviewing witnesses who participated in
the June 9 meeting. The President thereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of
Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information about the June 9 meeting.
The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the emails
and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
the President dictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr.&#x00A0;in response to
the first press accounts of the June 9 meeting that said the meeting was about
adoption.
</p><!--l. 2999--><p class="indent" >   But as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to
prevent the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up
the June 9 meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement
recorded by Corallo - that the emails &#8221;will never get out&#8221; - can be explained as
reflecting a belief that the emails would not be made public if the President&#8217;s press
strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to Congress and the Special
Counsel.

additional steps to have Sessions reverse his recusal. In particular, at some point

According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that
Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary
Clinton, and the &#8221;gist&#8221; of the conversation was that the President wanted
Sessions to unrecuse from &#8221;all of it,&#8221; including the Special Counsel&#8217;s Russia

During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President again
suggested that Sessions could &#8221;unrecuse,&#8221; which Porter linked to taking back
supervision of the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary
Clinton.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said,
&#8221;I don&#8217;t know if you could un-recuse yourself. You&#8217;d be a hero. Not telling you
to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get involved. Can order AG
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
to investigate. I don&#8217;t want to get involved. I&#8217;m not going to get involved. I&#8217;m
not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated
fairly.&#8221;<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Sessions also said, &#8221;I never saw anything that was improper,&#8221; which Porter
thought was noteworthy because it did not fit with the previous discussion about

When asked whether Holder had been a more loyal Attorney General to President
Obama than Sessions was to him, the President said, &#8221;I don&#8217;t want to get into
loyalty, but I will tell you that, I will say this: Holder protected President
Obama. Totally protected him. When you look at the things that they did,
and Holder protected the president. And I have great respect for that, I&#8217;ll be

In a meeting in the White House residence that Porter attended on January 27, 2018, Porter
recalled that the President talked about the great attorney she had in the past with successful

<!--l. 3168--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control
of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidence are relevant to the
elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 3170--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> To determine if the President&#8217;s efforts to have the Attorney General
unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on
whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would
take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play
in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney
General&#8217;s recusal covered other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not turn on
what Attorney General Sessions would actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts
to reverse his recusal would naturally have had the effect of impeding the Russia
investigation.
</p><!--l. 3176--><p class="indent" >   On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his
recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and
prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessions recalled the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive. When the
President raised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by
Porter, &#8221;Not telling you to do anything.... I&#8217;m not going to get involved. I&#8217;m not going to
do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.&#8221; The duration of
the President&#8217;s efforts - which spanned from March 2017 to August 2018 - and the
fact that the President repeatedly criticized Sessions in public and in private for
failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is relevant to assessing
whether the President&#8217;s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as obstructive
acts.
</p><!--l. 3184--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence of a
grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition,
in July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the
District of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August
2017.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn776x2" id="fn776x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">776</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-226025f776"></a>
Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on
those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the
obstructive-act element.
</p><!--l. 3191--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President&#8217;s conduct toward
Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and
supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope. By the summer of 2017, the
President was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating him personally
for obstruction of justice. And in the wake of the disclosures of emails about
the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the campaign, see
Volume II, Section II.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the
campaign now included the President&#8217;s son, son-in-law, and former campaign
manager. The President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions
publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to
future election interference. Yet Sessions remained recused. In December 2017,
shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to Sessions in the Oval
Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if he
unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President&#8217;s desire that Sessions take
back supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary
Clinton. The President said in that meeting that he &#8221;just want[ed] to be treated
fairly,&#8221; which could reflect his perception that it was unfair that he was being
investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a principal effect of that act would be to
restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the Attorney General - a position
that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by someone like Eric
Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their
presidents. A reasonable inference from those statements and the President&#8217;s
actions is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would
play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia
investigation.

McGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but
McGahn had refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the
President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn
deny that he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel. Each time he was
approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute the press accounts
because they were accurate in reporting on the President&#8217;s effort to have the
Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahn in
the Oval Office with only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to
say that the President never ordered him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn
refused and insisted his memory of the President&#8217;s direction to remove the Special
Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President challenged McGahn for
taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had told
Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel
removed.

<!--l. 3403--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to
have the Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of
obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 3405--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The President&#8217;s repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record
denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would
qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn
from testifying truthfully or to undermine his credibility as a potential witness
if he testified consistently with his memory, rather than with what the record
said.
</p><!--l. 3408--><p class="indent" >   There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post
stories were published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong
and that he had never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
President correctly understood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he
planned to resign. In addition, the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not
sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the
President said, &#8221;I never said to fire Mueller. I never said &#8217;fire.&#8221;&#8221; That evidence could
indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade McGahn to change
his story but was instead offering his own - but different - recollection of the
substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn&#8217;s reaction to
them.
</p><!--l. 3414--><p class="indent" >   Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President&#8217;s conduct. As
previously described, see Volume II, Section III, supra, substantial evidence supports
McGahn&#8217;s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel
removed, including the timing and context of the President&#8217;s directive; the manner in which
McGahn reacted; and the fact that the President had been told the conflicts
were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department of Justice, and
should be raised with the President&#8217;s personal counsel rather than brought to
McGahn. In addition, the President&#8217;s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn
to have the Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked
about the New York Times story, the President said, &#8221;Fake news, folks. Fake
news. A typical New York Times fake story.&#8221; And when the President spoke with
McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had used the word &#8221;fire,&#8221;
saying, &#8221;I never said to fire Mueller. I never said &#8217;fire&#8217;&#8221; and &#8221;Did I say the word
&#8217;fire&#8217;?&#8221; The President&#8217;s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never
directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the
evidence.
</p><!--l. 3424--><p class="indent" >   In addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn&#8217;s memory of the
June 17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the
Oval Office meeting that McGahn&#8217;s account differed and that McGahn was firm in his
views. Shortly after the story broke, the President&#8217;s counsel told McGahn&#8217;s counsel that
the President wanted McGahn to make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the
Special Counsel, but McGahn responded through his counsel that that aspect of the story
was accurate and he therefore could not comply with the President&#8217;s request.
The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the story, but
McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting
on the President&#8217;s order. Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a
correction. More than a week later, the President brought up the issue again with
Porter, made comments indicating the President thought McGahn had leaked
the story, and directed Porter to have McGahn create a record denying that the
President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that point, the President said he
might &#8221;have to get rid of&#8217; McGahn if McGahn did not comply. McGahn again
refused and told Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the
President&#8217;s counsel, that the President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein
remove the Special Counsel. That evidence indicates that by the time of the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not think the
story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record
denying facts that McGahn believed to be true. The President nevertheless persisted
and asked McGahn to repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were
accurate.
</p><!--l. 3435--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> By January 2018, the Special Counsel&#8217;s use of a grand
jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also
was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events
because, among other reasons, on January 8, 2018, the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office
provided his counsel with a detailed list of topics for a possible interview with the
President.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn830x2" id="fn830x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">830</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-229047f830"></a>
The President knew that McGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the
Special Counsel was investigating and that McGahn had already been interviewed by
Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval Office meeting, the President indicated he
knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office about the President&#8217;s effort to
remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged McGahn for disclosing that
information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating unnecessary legal exposure.
That evidence indicates the President&#8217;s awareness that the June 17, 2017 events were
relevant to the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation and any grand jury investigation that might
grow out of it.
</p><!--l. 3445--><p class="indent" >   To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President&#8217;s actions would
have the natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or
prevent the communication of information to investigators. Because McGahn had spoken to
Special Counsel investigators before January 2018, the President could not have
been seeking to influence his prior statements in those interviews. But because
McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and the obstruction inquiry was not
complete, it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again on obstruction-related
topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking to have
McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further
investigative interviews would not be shown. But the President&#8217;s efforts to have
McGahn write a letter &#8221;for our records&#8221; approximately ten days after the stories had
come out - well past the typical time to issue a correction for a news story -
indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead
likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings arising from
it.
</p><!--l. 3451--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that
he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose
of influencing McGahn&#8217;s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the
President&#8217;s conduct towards the investigation.
</p><!--l. 3454--><p class="indent" >   inquiry. Several facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated
attempts to get McGahn to change his story. As described above, by the time
of the last attempt, the evidence suggests that the President had been told on
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President had ordered him to have the
Special Counsel terminated. McGahn interpreted his encounter with the President
in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he
was to his memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the
groundwork for pressing McGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might
be necessary to fire McGahn if he did not deny the story, and Porter relayed
that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the President&#8217;s intent may be
gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the prospect
of the President&#8217;s meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn&#8217;s counsel and
said that McGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office
that day. The President&#8217;s counsel was well aware of McGahn&#8217;s resolve not to
issue what he believed to be a false account of events despite the President&#8217;s
request. Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the Special Counsel
investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for telling
this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President&#8217;s statements reflect
his understanding - and his displeasure - that those events would be part of an
obstruction-of-justice

Giuliani was reported to have publicly said that Manafort remained in a joint defense
agreement with the President following Manafort&#8217;s guilty plea and agreement to cooperate,

<!--l. 3783--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, ________ ___ _____________
_____________, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of
justice:
</p><!--l. 3785--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The President&#8217;s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel&#8217;s
investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to
prevent particular witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have
the probable effect of influencing, delaying, or preventing their testimony to law
enforcement.
</p><!--l. 3788--><p class="indent" >   With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn
encouraging him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him
before he began to cooperate with the government. When Flynn&#8217;s attorneys withdrew him
from a joint defense agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially
cooperating with the government, the President&#8217;s personal counsel initially reminded
Flynn&#8217;s counsel of the President&#8217;s warm feelings towards Flynn and said &#8221;that still
remains.&#8221; But when Flynn&#8217;s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share
information under a joint defense agreement, the President&#8217;s personal counsel stated
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn&#8217;s hostility towards the
President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn&#8217;s
decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege
issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally
involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn&#8217;s
counsel.
</p><!--l. 3794--><p class="indent" >   With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President&#8217;s actions had the
potential to influence Manafort&#8217;s decision whether to cooperate with the government.
The President and his personal counsel made repeated statements suggesting
that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort, while also making it clear that the
President did not want Manafort to &#8221;flip&#8221; and cooperate with the government.
On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort&#8217;s D.C. case was
considering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he &#8221;felt badly&#8221; for
Manafort and stated, &#8221;I think a lot of it is very unfair.&#8221; And when asked about a
pardon for Manafort, the President said, &#8221;I do want to see people treated fairly.
That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about.&#8221; Later that day, after Manafort&#8217;s bail was revoked, the
President called it a &#8221;tough sentence&#8221; that was &#8221;Very unfair!&#8221; Two days later,
the President&#8217;s personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the Special
Counsel&#8217;s investigation could receive a pardon &#8221;if in fact the [P]resident and his
advisors ... come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly&#8221;&#8217; - using
language that paralleled how the President had already described the treatment of
Manafort. Those statements, combined with the President&#8217;s commendation of
Manafort for being a &#8221;brave man&#8221; who &#8221;refused to&#8221; break&#8217;,&#8221; suggested that a
pardon was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with
the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a
cooperation agreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to
investigators.
</p><!--l. 3803--><p class="indent" >   The President&#8217;s public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury
deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of
trial, for example, the President called the prosecution a &#8221;terrible situation&#8221; and
a &#8221;hoax&#8221; that &#8221;continues to stain our country&#8221; and referred to Manafort as a
&#8221;Reagan/Dole darling&#8221; who was &#8221;serving solitary confinement&#8221; even though he was
&#8221;convicted of nothing.&#8221; Those statements were widely picked up by the press.
While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case
and are presumed to follow those instructions, the President&#8217;s statements during
the trial generated substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if
they happened to see the statements or learned about them from others. And
the President&#8217;s statements during jury deliberations that Manafort &#8221;happens
to be a very good person&#8221; and that &#8221;it&#8217;s very sad what they&#8217;ve done to Paul
Manafort&#8221; had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which
the President made just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit
Manafort.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 3809--><p class="indent" >   ______ __ ________ _____________
</p><!--l. 3811--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> The President&#8217;s actions towards Flynn, Manafort,
appear to have been connected to pending or anticipated official proceedings
involving each individual. The President&#8217;s conduct towards Flynn principally
occurred when both were under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel&#8217;s
Office and press reports speculated about whether they would cooperate with the
Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation. And the President&#8217;s conduct towards Manafort was
directly connected to the official proceedings involving him. The President made
statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort&#8217;s criminal
trial. And the President&#8217;s comments about the prospect of Manafort &#8221;flipping&#8221;
occurred when it was clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury
proceedings.
</p><!--l. 3818--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Evidence concerning the President&#8217;s intent related to Flynn as a potential
witness is inconclusive. As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have
evidence establishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel&#8217;s
communications with Flynn&#8217;s counsel stating that Flynn&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the
joint defense agreement and cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting
&#8221;hostility&#8221; towards the President. And regardless of what the President&#8217;s personal counsel
communicated, the President continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded
guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, stating that Flynn had &#8221;led a very
strong life&#8221; and the President &#8221;fe[lt] very badly&#8221; about what had happened to
him.
</p><!--l. 3823--><p class="indent" >   Evidence concerning the President&#8217;s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the
President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before
Manafort was convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated
unfairly. One day after Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially
faced a lengthy prison term, the President said that Manafort was &#8221;a brave man&#8221; for
refusing to &#8221;break&#8221; and that &#8221;flipping&#8221; &#8221;almost ought to be outlawed.&#8221; At the same time,
although the President had privately told aides he did not like Manafort, he publicly called
Manafort &#8221;a good man&#8221; and said he had a &#8221;wonderful family.&#8221; And when the President
was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the President did not
respond directly and instead said he had &#8221;great respect for what [Manafort]&#8217;s done,
in terms of what he&#8217;s gone through.&#8221; The President added that &#8221;some of the
charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington
probably does.&#8221; In light of the President&#8217;s counsel&#8217;s previous statements that
the investigations &#8221;might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons&#8221; and
that a pardon would be possible if the President &#8221;come[s] to the conclusion that
you have been treated unfairly,&#8221; the evidence supports the inference that the
President intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon, which would
make cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence
unnecessary.
</p><!--l. 3831--><p class="indent" >   We also examined the evidence of the President&#8217;s intent in making public statements
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
about Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some
evidence supports a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence
the jury. The trial generated widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate,
commentators suggested that an acquittal would add to pressure to end the Special
Counsel&#8217;s investigation. By publicly stating on the second day of deliberations that
Manafort &#8221;happens to be a very good person&#8221; and that &#8221;it&#8217;s very sad what they&#8217;ve done to
Paul Manafort&#8221; right after calling the Special Counsel&#8217;s investigation a &#8221;rigged witch
hunt,&#8221; the President&#8217;s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural
tendency to engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a fact finder
could infer that the President intended that result. But there are alternative
explanations for the President&#8217;s comments, including that he genuinely felt sorry for
Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to influence public
opinion. The President&#8217;s comments also could have been intended to continue
sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above,
the President made his comments about Manafort being &#8221;a very good person&#8221;
immediately after declining to answer a question about whether he would pardon
Manafort.

<!--l. 3847--><p class="noindent" >The President&#8217;s conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our investigation.
During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the
Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times,
including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the
media began questioning Trump&#8217;s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a &#8221;party line&#8221;
that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen
continued to adhere to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide
documents and testimony in its Russia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the
President&#8217;s connections to Russia, Cohen submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that
he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower Moscow project three times, that he did
not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen had not received a
response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project
ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
working on the congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the
President&#8217;s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should
not contradict the President and should keep the statement short and &#8221;tight.&#8221;
After the FBI searched Cohen&#8217;s home and office in April 2018, the President
publicly asserted that Cohen would not &#8221;flip&#8221; and privately passed messages
of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President&#8217;s personal
counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the
President would do &#8221;something else&#8221; to make the investigation end. But after
Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the President publicly
criticized him, called him a &#8221;rat,&#8221; and suggested his family members had committed
crimes.

in a congressional hearing, the President made additional public comments suggesting that
Cohen&#8217;s family members had committed crimes. In an interview on Fox on January 12,
2019, the President was asked whether he was worried about Cohen&#8217;s testimony and

<!--l. 4476--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#8217;s conduct related to Cohen, the following evidence is relevant
to the elements of obstruction of justice.
</p><!--l. 4478--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> We gathered evidence of the President&#8217;s conduct related to Cohen on
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen&#8217;s false
statements to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the
natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the
government.
</p><!--l. 4483--><p class="indent" >   First, with regard to Cohen&#8217;s false statements to Congress, while there is evidence,
described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress
about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish
that the President directed or aided Cohen&#8217;s false testimony.
</p><!--l. 4485--><p class="indent" >   Cohen said that his statements to Congress followed a &#8221;party line&#8221; that developed
within the campaign to align with the President&#8217;s public statements distancing the
President from Russia. Cohen also recalled that, in speaking with the President in advance
of testifying, he made it clear that he would stay on message - which Cohen believed
they both understood would require false testimony. But Cohen said that he
and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen&#8217;s testimony about
the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did
not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the
President about the specifics of his planned testimony. During the time when his
statement to Congress was being drafted and circulated to members of the JDA,
Cohen did not speak directly to the President about the statement, but rather
communicated with the President&#8217;s personal counsel - as corroborated by phone
records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President&#8217;s
personal counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before
Congress.
</p><!--l. 4491--><p class="indent" >   Cohen recalled that in his discussions with the President&#8217;s personal counsel on August
27, 2017 - the day before Cohen&#8217;s statement was submitted to Congress - Cohen said that
there were more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate
Trump than the statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time.
According to Cohen, the President&#8217;s personal counsel - who did not have first-hand
knowledge of the project - responded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water,
that it was unnecessary to include those details because the project did not take place, and
that Cohen should keep his statement short and tight, not elaborate, stay on
message, and not contradict the President. Cohen&#8217;s recollection of the content of
those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen&#8217;s
draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA. For example,
Cohen omitted any reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to
set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the United Nations General
Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of the JDA to delete the sentence,
&#8221;The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian government
officials.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 4497--><p class="indent" >   The President&#8217;s personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his
conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the
President was aware of the information Cohen provided to the President&#8217;s personal counsel.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
The President&#8217;s conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by
attorney-client privilege, and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such
communications. The absence of evidence about the President and his counsel&#8217;s
conversations about the drafting of Cohen&#8217;s statement precludes us from assessing what, if
any, role the President played.
</p><!--l. 4501--><p class="indent" >   Second, we considered whether the President took actions that would have the natural
tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal investigators or
to Congress.
</p><!--l. 4503--><p class="indent" >   Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly
and privately urged Cohen to stay on message and not &#8221;flip.&#8221; Cohen recalled
the President&#8217;s personal counsel telling him that he would be protected so long
as he did not go &#8221;rogue.&#8221; In the days and weeks that followed the April 2018
searches of Cohen&#8217;s home and office, the President told reporters that Cohen was a
&#8221;good man&#8221; and said he was&#8221; a fine person with a wonderful family ... who I
have always liked &amp; respected.&#8221; Privately, the President told Cohen to &#8221;hang in
there&#8221; and &#8221;stay strong.&#8221; People who were close to both Cohen and the President
passed messages to Cohen that &#8221;the President loves you,&#8221;&#8221;the boss loves you,&#8221;
and &#8221;everyone knows the boss has your back.&#8221; Through the President&#8217;s personal
counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen &#8221;thanks for what you do&#8221;
after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that,
according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew was false. At that time, the
Trump Organization continued to pay Cohen&#8217;s legal fees, which was important
to Cohen. Cohen also recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the
President&#8217;s personal counsel, who told him to stay on message and everything
would be fine. The President indicated in his public statements that a pardon had
not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that &#8221;[m]ost people will flip if the
Government lets them out of trouble&#8221; but that he &#8221;d[idn&#8217;t] see Michael doing
that.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 4511--><p class="indent" >   After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however,
the President accused Cohen of &#8221;mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an
unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?),&#8221; called Cohen a &#8221;rat,&#8221; and on multiple occasions
publicly suggested that Cohen&#8217;s family members had committed crimes. The
evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference that the
President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get
Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the
provision of information or undermine Cohen&#8217;s credibility once Cohen began
cooperating.
</p><!--l. 4514--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> The President&#8217;s relevant conduct towards Cohen
occurred when the President knew the Special Counsel&#8217;s Office, Congress, and the U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York were investigating Cohen&#8217;s
conduct. The President acknowledged through his public statements and tweets that Cohen
potentially could cooperate with the government investigations.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 4518--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> In analyzing the President&#8217;s intent in his actions towards Cohen as a potential
witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended
to discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen&#8217;s
information would shed adverse light on the President&#8217;s campaign-period conduct and
statements.
</p><!--l. 4521--><p class="indent" >   Cohen&#8217;s false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project was
designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit the
congressional and DOJ Russia investigations - a goal that was in the President&#8217;s interest, as
reflected by the President&#8217;s own statements. During and after the campaign, the President
made repeated statements that he had &#8221;no business&#8221; in Russia and said that there were
&#8221;no deals that could happen in Russia, because we&#8217;ve stayed away.&#8221; As Cohen knew, and as
he recalled communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen&#8217;s pursuit of the
Trump Tower Moscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these
statements.
</p><!--l. 4525--><p class="indent" >   In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations
with candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow
project, that the conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that
he discussed with Trump possible travel to Russia to pursue the project. The
conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, because the project had the
potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from Cohen and other
records further establish that Cohen&#8217;s efforts to advance the project did not end
in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the
timing for possible trips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the
project.
</p><!--l. 4529--><p class="indent" >   The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these
facts at the time of Cohen&#8217;s false statements to Congress. Cohen discussed the
project with the President in early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled
that on September 20, 2017, the day after he released to the public his opening
remarks to Congress - which said the project &#8221;was terminated in January of 2016&#8221; -
the President&#8217;s personal counsel told him the President was pleased with what
Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. And after Cohen&#8217;s guilty plea, the
President told reporters that he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which
supports the inference that he remained aware of his own involvement in the
project and the period during the Campaign in which the project was&#8217; being
pursued.
</p><!--l. 4534--><p class="indent" >   The President&#8217;s public remarks following Cohen&#8217;s guilty plea also suggest that the
President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump
Tower Moscow project. At the time the President submitted written answers to
questions from this Office about the project and other subjects, the media had
reported that Cohen was cooperating with the government but Cohen had not yet
pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress. Accordingly, it was not
publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided to the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about
the timing and substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and
gave no indication that he had decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after
Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly stated that he had personally made
the decision to abandon the project. The President then declined to clarify the
seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content
and timing of the President&#8217;s provision of information about his knowledge and
actions regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President
may have been concerned about the information that Cohen could provide as a
witness.
</p><!--l. 4542--><p class="indent" >   The President&#8217;s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed at the
Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President&#8217;s dealings
with Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow. There also is some
evidence that the President&#8217;s concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the
President&#8217;s stated belief that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in
an attempt to obtain a lesser sentence for his unrelated criminal conduct. The President
tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, refused to &#8221;break&#8221; and &#8221;make up stories in order to
get a &#8217;deal.&#8217;&#8221; And after Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, the
President said, &#8221;what [Cohen]&#8217;s trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So he&#8217;s lying about
a project that everybody knew about.&#8221; But the President also appeared to defend
the underlying conduct, saying, &#8221;Even if [Cohen] was right, it doesn&#8217;t matter
because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.&#8221; As described
above, there is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false
statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect
the President and minimize the President&#8217;s connections to Russia during the
campaign.
</p><!--l. 4549--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President&#8217;s statements insinuating that members of Cohen&#8217;s family
committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed
as an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to
the President by Cohen or others. It is possible that the President believes, as
reflected in his tweets, that Cohen &#8221;ma[d]e[] up stories&#8221; in order to get a deal for
himself and &#8221;get his wife and father-in-law ... off Scott Free.&#8221; It also is possible
that the President&#8217;s mention of Cohen&#8217;s wife and father-in-law were not intended
to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy
aimed at discrediting Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on
Cohen-related matters. But the President&#8217;s suggestion that Cohen&#8217;s family members
committed crimes happened more than once, including just before Cohen was
sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen &#8221;should, in my
opinion, serve a full and complete sentence&#8221;) and again just before Cohen was
scheduled to testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an
inference that they were intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further
cooperation.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 4554--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">L.   </span> <a 
 id="x1-240000L."></a>Overarching Factual Issues</h4>
<!--l. 4556--><p class="noindent" >Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination
decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts
concerning the President&#8217;s course of conduct.
</p><!--l. 4558--><p class="indent" >   Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland
obstruction-of-justice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice.
</p><!--l. 4560--><p class="indent" >   First, the conduct involved actions by the President. Some of the conduct did
not implicate the President&#8217;s constitutional authority and raises garden-variety
obstruction-of-justice issues. Other events we investigated, however, drew upon
the President&#8217;s Article II authority, which raised constitutional issues that we
address in Volume II, Section III-B, infra. A factual analysis of that conduct would
have to take into account both that the President&#8217;s acts were facially lawful and
that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and
powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential
witnesses.
</p><!--l. 4565--><p class="indent" >   Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up
of an underlying crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence
that the individual had an improper obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States
v.&#x00A0;Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir.&#x00A0;1988), or that he contemplated an effect
on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v.&#x00A0;Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 591
(2d Cir.&#x00A0;2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction
offense. See United States v.&#x00A0;Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir.&#x00A0;2017) (stating, in
applying the obstruction sentencing guideline, that &#8221;obstruction of a criminal
investigation is punishable even if the prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or
even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying crime&#8221;). Obstruction of
justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests,
to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a
gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the
justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying
wrong.
</p><!--l. 4572--><p class="indent" >   In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was
involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the
evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the
President&#8217;s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would
call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about
whether certain events - such as advance notice of WikiLeaks&#8217;s release of hacked
information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and
Russians - could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
family.
</p><!--l. 4576--><p class="indent" >   Third, many of the President&#8217;s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of
cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in
public view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were
motivated by a corrupt intent, the President&#8217;s power to influence actions, persons, and
events is enhanced by his unique ability to attract attention through use of mass
communications. And no principle of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction
statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony,
the justice system&#8217;s integrity is equally threatened.
</p><!--l. 4581--><p class="indent" >   Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts - e.g., the President&#8217;s
statement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his
efforts to remove the Special Counsel - it is important to view the President&#8217;s pattern of
conduct as a whole. That pattern sheds light on the nature of the President&#8217;s acts and the
inferences that can be drawn about his intent.
</p><!--l. 4584--><p class="indent" >   Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting
undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and
obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one
meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels.
These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of
the Attorney General&#8217;s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the
scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the
potential to influence their testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help to
illuminate their significance. For example, the President&#8217;s direction to McGahn to have
the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by his direction
to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia
investigation to prospective election - interference only - a temporal connection that
suggests that both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 4590--><p class="indent" >   The President&#8217;s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that
is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or
accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately
resulted in Flynn&#8217;s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell
the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead
prepared to resign over the President&#8217;s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not
deliver the President&#8217;s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia
investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from
his recollections about events surrounding the President&#8217;s direction to have the
Special Counsel removed, despite the President&#8217;s multiple demands that he do so.
Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential
obstruction charges against the President&#8217;s aides and associates beyond those already
filed.
</p><!--l. 4597--><p class="indent" >   In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President&#8217;s actions can
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President&#8217;s motives. In
the first phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the
FBI had not opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically
important to make public that he was not under investigation, and he included that
information in his termination letter to Comey after other efforts to have that information
disclosed were unsuccessful.
</p><!--l. 4601--><p class="indent" >   Soon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were
conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked
a significant change in the President&#8217;s conduct and the start of a second phase of action.
The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved
in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the
President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For
instance, the President attempted to remove the Special Counsel; he sought to
have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the investigation; he
sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting
between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack
potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who
declined to cooperate with the government. Judgments about the nature of the
President&#8217;s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
evidence.

President</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The Presidents personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and constitutional
defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the Presidents
conduct.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-241001f1072"></a>
As a statutory matter, the Presidents counsel has argued that a core
obstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1512(c)(2), does not cover the Presidents
actions.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-241002f1073"></a>
As a constitutional matter, the Presidents counsel argued that the
President cannot obstruct justice by exercising his constitutional authority
to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate the FBI
Director.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1074x2" id="fn1074x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1074</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-241003f1074"></a>
Under that view, any statute that restricts the Presidents exercise of those powers would
impermissibly intrude on the Presidents constitutional role. The Presidents counsel has
conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve
exercises of his Article II authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning
perjury.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1075x2" id="fn1075x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1075</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-241004f1075"></a>
But counsel has made a categorical argument that the Presidents exercise
of his constitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and
to close investigations cannot constitutionally constitute obstruction of
justice.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing counsels statutory arguments, we concluded that the Presidents
proposed interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position
of the Department of Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory

</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   As for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and
the courts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed
the Presidents position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing
the separation of powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article II of the
Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize the President
from potential liability for the conduct that we investigated. Rather, our analysis
led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can validly prohibit a
Presidents corrupt efforts to use his official powers to curtail, end, or interfere with an
investigation.

While defendants have argued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that
would impair the availability or integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(1)s
focus, strong arguments weigh against that proposed limitation. The text of Section
1512(c)(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to Section 1512(c)(1); courts have so
interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no principle of statutory
construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section 1512(c)(2) applies to
all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated - including by
improper exercises of official power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are
potentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of
proceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. <span

 id="x1-2430001."></a>The Text of Section 1512(c)(2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive
Acts</h5>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Several textual features of Section 1512(c)(2) support the conclusion that the
provision broadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by
the more specific prohibitions in Section 1512(c)(1), which focus on evidence
impairment.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   First, the text of Section 1512(c)(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that obstruct[],
influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding when committed corruptly. Nothing in
Section 1512(c)(2)s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity
or availability of evidence for use in an official proceeding. In contrast, Section
1512(c)(1) explicitly includes the requirement that the defendant act with the intent to
impair the objects integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding, a
requirement that Congress also included in two other sections of Section 1512.
<span 
class="cmti-12">See </span>18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span>1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
person to destroy an object with intent to impair the integrity or availability of

threats, corrupt persuasion, or misleading conduct with intent to cause a person to
destroy an object with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object
for use in an official proceeding). But no comparable intent or conduct element
focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2). The intent element
in Section 1512(c)(2) comes from the word corruptly. <span 
class="cmti-12">See, e.g., United States</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;McKibbins</span>, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir.&#x00A0;2011) (The intent element is important
because the word corruptly is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of
obstruction.) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section
1512(c)(2) is obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing] a proceeding. Congress is
presumed to have acted intentionally in the disparate inclusion and exclusion of
evidence-impairment language. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Loughrin v.</span><span

another - let alone in the very next provision - this Court presume[s] that Congress
intended a difference in meaning) (quoting <span

(2018).
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Second, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section 1512(c)(2)
defines an independent offense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with
different elements from Section 1512(c)(1) - and each subsection of Section 1512(c) contains
its own attempt prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions. The two
subsections of Section 1512(c) are connected by the conjunction or, indicating that each
provides an alternative basis for criminal liability. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Loughrin</span>, 573 U.S. at 357 (ordinary
use [of or] is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given
separate meanings) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <span 
class="cmti-12">Loughrin</span>, for example, the
Supreme Court relied on the use of the word or to hold that adjacent and overlapping
subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>1344, state distinct offenses and that
subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be interpreted to contain an additional
element specified only in subsection 1344(1). <span

And here, as in <span 
class="cmti-12">Loughrin</span>, Section 1512(c)s two clauses have separate numbers, line breaks
before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation - thus placing the clauses
visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings. 573 U.S. at

</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Third, the introductory word otherwise in Section 1512(c)(2) signals that the provision
covers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512(c)(1). <span

The purpose of the word otherwise in Section 1512(c)(2) is therefore to clarify that the
provision covers obstructive acts <span

intent to impair its integrity or availability, which is the conduct addressed in

</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   Section 1512(c)(2)s breadth is reinforced by the similarity of its language to the

impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.
That clause of Section 1503 follows two more specific clauses that protect jurors,
judges, and court officers. The omnibus clause has nevertheless been construed
to be far more general in scope than the earlier clauses of the statute. <span

(collecting cases). Given the similarity of Section 1512(c)(2) to Section 1503s
omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts
that produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions - i.e., the
result of obstructing justice - rather than covering only acts that were similar in
manner. Read this way, Section 1512(c)(2) serves a distinct function in the federal
obstruction-of-justice statutes: it captures corrupt conduct, other than document
destruction, that has the natural tendency to obstruct contemplated as well as pending

class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;United States</span>, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014)

adopting a narrow meaning of tangible object in an obstruction statute when the

As noted above, no Department of Justice position or Supreme Court precedent directly
resolved this issue. We did not find counsels contention, however, to accord with our
reading of the Supreme Court authority addressing separation-of-powers issues. Applying
the Courts framework for analysis, we concluded that Congress can validly regulate the
Presidents exercise of official duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt intent to
obstruct justice. The limited effect on presidential power that results from that restriction

interpretation. It is not obvious how a clear-statement rule would apply to an
omnibus provision like Section 1512(c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive
acts only when carried out in the Presidents conduct of office. No statutory term
could easily bear that specialized meaning. For example, the word corruptly has a
well-established meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power for corrupt ends.
Indeed, an established definition states that corruptly means action with an intent

   Under the Supreme Courts balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers issues, the
first task is to assess the degree to which applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to
presidential actions affects the Presidents ability to carry out his Article II responsibilities.
<span 
class="cmti-12">Administrator of General Services</span>, 433 U.S. at 443. As discussed above, applying
obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential conduct that does not involve the Presidents
conduct of office - such as influencing the testimony of witnesses - is constitutionally
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
unproblematic. The President has no more right than other citizens to impede official
proceedings by corruptly influencing witness testimony. The conduct would be equally
improper whether effectuated through direct efforts to produce false testimony or suppress
the truth, or through the actual, threatened, or promised use of official powers to achieve
the same result.
</p><!--l. 414--><p class="indent" >   The Presidents action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions,or
discharging law enforcement officials, raises different questions. Each type of action involves
the exercise of executive discretion in furtherance of the Presidents duty to take Care that
the Laws be faithfully executed. <span 
class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">U.S. C<span

class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">&#x00A0;II</span>, <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>3. Congress may not
supplant the Presidents exercise of executive power to supervise prosecutions or to
remove officers who occupy law enforcement positions. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Bowsher v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Synar</span>, 478
U.S. 714, 726-727 (1986) (Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal
of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment. ...
[Because t]he structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute the
laws, ... [t]his kind of congressional control over the execution of the laws ... is
constitutionally impermissible.). Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not
aggrandize power in Congress or usurp executive authority. Instead, they impose a
discrete limitation on conduct only when it is taken with the corrupt intent to
obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus would restrict presidential action only
by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official proceedings for the
improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume II, Section III.A.3,
<span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>.
</p><!--l. 424--><p class="indent" >   The direct effect on the Presidents freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited
one. A preclusion of corrupt official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers. For
example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President
to act with the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial
liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits
official action undertaken for such personal purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the
impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. And the Constitution does not
mandate that the President have unfettered authority to direct investigations or
prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever,in order to carry out his Article II functions. <span

</p><!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   Where the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation on the
removal of an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to
bar removal for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. Limiting the range of
permissible reasons for removal to exclude a corrupt purpose imposes a lesser restraint on
the President than requiring an affirmative showing of good cause. It follows that for such
inferior officers, Congress may constitutionally restrict the Presidents removal authority if
that authority was exercised for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. And even if a
particular inferior officers position might be of such importance to the execution of the laws
that the President must have at-will removal authority, the obstruction-of-justice
statutes could still be constitutionally applied to forbid removal for a corrupt
reason.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded corrupt action would leave
ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over policy or loss of
confidence in the officers judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose prohibition therefore
would not undermine the Presidents ability to perform his Article II functions. Accordingly,
because the separation-of-powers question is whether the removal restrictions are of such
a nature that they impede the Presidents ability to perform his constitutional
duty, <span 
class="cmti-12">Morrison</span>, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for
a corrupt reason - a reason grounded in achieving personal rather than official
ends - does not seriously hinder the Presidents performance of his duties. The
President retains broad latitude to supervise investigations and remove officials,
circumscribed in this context only by the requirement that he not act for corrupt personal
purposes.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties</h5>
<!--l. 536--><p class="noindent" >Applying the obstruction statutes to the Presidents official conduct would involve
determining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act
had a nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent. But
applying those standards to the Presidents official conduct should not hinder
his ability to perform his Article II duties. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cf.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Nixon v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Fitzgerald</span>, 457 U.S. at
752-753 &amp; n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on the President in adopting a
constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages action
based on official duties). Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect: the
existence of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial
actions, and the existence of evidentiary limitations on probing the Presidents
motives. And historical experience confirms that no impermissible chill should
exist.
</p><!--l. 542--><p class="indent" >   a. As an initial matter, the term corruptly sets a demanding standard. It requires a
concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an improper advantage
for [him]self or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of
others. BALLENTINES LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed.&#x00A0;1969); <span 
class="cmti-12">see United States</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Pasha</span>, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir.&#x00A0;2015); <span 
class="cmti-12">Aguilar</span>, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard parallels the Presidents
constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And virtually
everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear
governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly,
the President has no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually
all instances, there will be no credible basis for suspecting a corrupt personal
motive.
</p><!--l. 550--><p class="indent" >   That point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the
stringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a
criminal investigation into his own or his family members conduct to protect against
personal embarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly
motivated conduct. So too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly
and adversely affected the Presidents financial interests for the purpose of protecting those
interests. In those examples, official power is being used for the purpose of protecting the
Presidents personal interests. In contrast, the Presidents actions to serve political
or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt. The Presidents role as head of
the government necessarily requires him to take into account political factors in
making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings. For
instance, the Presidents decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid
international friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The
criminal law does not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy
factors in the conduct of government. And when legitimate interests animate the
Presidents conduct, those interests will almost invariably be readily identifiable
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
based on objective factors. Because the Presidents conduct in those instances will
obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling concern should
arise.
</p><!--l. 561--><p class="indent" >   b. There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would
occur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe
that obstruction occurred. Prosecutorial action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent
clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged
their official duties. <span 
class="cmti-12">Armstrong</span>, 517 U.S. at 464 (<span 
class="cmti-12">quoting United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12">&#x00A0;Chemical</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Foundation, Inc.</span>, 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926)). The presumption of prosecutorial
regularity would provide even greater protection to the President than exists
in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any matter involving
the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough
and careful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice. Under
OLCs opinion that a sitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment,
only a successor Administration would be able to prosecute a former President.
But that consideration does not suggest that a President would have any basis
for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office. There are
obvious political checks against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution
of a former President. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Administrator of General Services</span>, 433 U.S. at 448

</p><!--l. 578--><p class="indent" >   These considerations distinguish the Supreme Courts holding in <span 
class="cmti-12">Nixon v. Fitzgerald</span>
that, in part because inquiries into the Presidents motives would be highly intrusive, the
President is absolutely immune from private civil damages actions based on his official
conduct. 457 U.S. at 756-757. As <span 
class="cmti-12">Fitzgerald </span>recognized,there is a lesser public interest in
actions for civil damages than, for example, in criminal prosecutions. <span 
class="cmti-12">Fitzgerald</span>,
457 U.S. at 754 n.37; see Cheney, 542 U.S. at 384. And private actions are not

</p><!--l. 584--><p class="indent" >   c. In the rare cases in which a substantial and credible basis justifies conducting
an investigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to
determine whether he acted for a corrupt purpose need not have a chilling effect.
Ascertaining the Presidents motivations would turn on any explanation he provided to
justify his actions, the advice he received, the circumstances surrounding the
actions, and the regularity or irregularity of the process he employed to make
decisions. But grand juries and courts would not have automatic access to confidential
presidential communications on those matters; rather, they could be presented in official
proceedings only on a showing of sufficient need. <span

</p><!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >   d. Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling
effect justifies exempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical
matter, Presidents have very seldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations.
And it is rarer still for circumstances to raise even the possibility of a corrupt
personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the Presidents use of official
power. Accordingly, the Presidents conduct of office should not be chilled based on
hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard in this
context.

we had a valid basis for investigating the conduct at issue in this report. In our

the Presidents performance of his Article II function to supervise prosecutorial
conduct or to remove inferior law-enforcement officers. And the protection of the
criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person - including the President -

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the Presidents conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
Presidents actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we
were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence
after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit
obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal
standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate
him.

<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >The President provided written responses through his personal counsel to questions
submitted to him by the Special Counsels Office. We first explain the process
that led to the submission of written questions and then attach the Presidents
responses.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Beginning in December 2017, this Office sought for more than a year to interview the
President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice.
We advised counsel that the President was a subject of the investigation under the
definition of the Justice Manual - a person whose conduct is within the scope of
the grand jurys investigation. Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span>9-11.151 (2018). We also advised
counsel that [a]n interview with the President is vital to our investigation and
that this Office had carefully considered the constitutional and other arguments
raised by... counsel, and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking an
interview.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x3" id="fn1x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260001f1"></a>
We additionally stated that it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public for an interview
to take place and offered numerous accommodations to aid the Presidents preparation and avoid
surprise.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x3" id="fn2x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260002f2"></a>
After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice about the Special Counsels
objective of securing the Presidents testimony, these accommodations included
the submissions of written questions to the President on certain Russia-related
topics.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x3" id="fn3x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260003f3"></a>
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   We received the Presidents written responses in late November
2018.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x3" id="fn4x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260004f4"></a>
In December 2018, we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several
respects.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn5x3" id="fn5x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260005f5"></a>
We noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he does
not recall or remember or have an independent recollection of information called for by the
questions.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn6x3" id="fn6x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260006f6"></a> Other answers
were incomplete or imprecise.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn7x3" id="fn7x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260007f7"></a>
The written responses, we informed counsel, demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format,
as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers
and potentially refresh your clients recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of
recollection.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn8x3" id="fn8x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260008f8"></a>
We again requested an in-person interview, limited to certain topics, advising the
Presidents counsel that [t]his is the Presidents opportunity to voluntarily provide us
with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have
gathered.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn9x3" id="fn9x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-260009f9"></a> The
President declined.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered
whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be
inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and
had produced substantial evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of
potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our
investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.
As explained in Volume II, Section II.B., we determined that the substantial
quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw
relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from
circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the
investigation.

   I have no recollection of learning at the time that Donald Trump, Jr., Paul
Manafort, or Jared Kushner was considering participating in a meeting in June
2016 concerning potentially negative information about Hillary Clinton. Nor do I
recall learning during the campaign that the June 9, 2016 meeting had taken
place, that the referenced emails existed, or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had other
communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June 3, 2016 and June
9, 2016.

<!--l. 445--><p class="noindent" ><span class="likeparagraphHead"><a

   I have no independent recollection of what portion of these four days in June of 2016 I
spent in Trump Tower. This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign,
as the primary season was ending and we were preparing for the general election
campaign.
</p><!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >   I am now aware that my Campaigns calendar indicates that I was in New York City
from June 6 -9, 2016. Calendars kept in my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various
calls and meetings scheduled for each of these days. While those calls and meetings
may or may not actually have taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump
Tower during a portion of each of these working days, and I have no reason to
doubt that I was. When I was in New York City, I stayed at my Trump Tower
apartment.
</p><!--l. 455--><p class="indent" >   My Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower
during portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave
Trump Tower in the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the
California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries
held that day. The June 8, 2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in late afternoon
to attend a ceremony at my sons school. The June 9, 2016 calendar indicates I was
scheduled to attend midday meetings and a fund raising luncheon at the Four Seasons
Hotel. At this point, I do not remember on what dates these events occurred, but I do
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as scheduled on my
calendar.
</p><!--l. 461--><p class="indent" >   Widely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my
activities during these days. For example, I am aware that my June 7, 2016 victory remarks
at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and
published by the media. I remember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering
remarks that evening.
</p><!--l. 465--><p class="indent" >   At this point in time, I do not remember whether I spoke or met with Donald Trump,
Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner on June 9, 2016. My desk calendar indicates I was
scheduled to meet with Paul Manafort on the morning of June 9, but I do not recall if that
meeting took place. It was more than two years ago, at a time when I had many calls and
interactions daily.

speech on probably Monday of next week and we&#8217;re going to be discussing all of the things
that have taken place with the Clintons. In general, I expected to give a speech referencing
the publicly available, negative information about the Clintons, including, for example,
Mrs.&#x00A0;Clintons failed policies, the Clintons use of the State Department to further their
interests and the interests of the Clinton Foundation, Mrs.&#x00A0;Clintons improper use of a
private server for State Department business, the destruction of 33,000 emails
on that server, and Mrs.&#x00A0;Clintons temperamental unsuitability for the office of
President.
</p><!--l. 486--><p class="indent" >   In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the
Campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution, and sources
of information for the speech I expected to give probably on the Monday following my June
7, 2016 comments. These documents generally show that the text of the speech was initially
drafted by Campaign staff with input from various outside advisors and was based on
publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book Clinton
Cash by Peter Schweizer.
</p><!--l. 489--><p class="indent" >   The Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack took place in the early morning hours of Sunday,
June 12, 2016. In light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed more specifically to
national security and terrorism than to the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the
Saint Anselm College Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported,
opened with the following:

      to  be  president.  There  will  be  plenty  of  opportunity  to  discuss  these

   Sometime in 2015, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility of a Trump
Organization project in Moscow. As I recall, Mr.&#x00A0;Cohen described this as a proposed
project of a general type we have done in the past in a variety of locations. I signed the
non-binding Letter of Intent attached to your questions as Exhibit B which required no
equity or expenditure on our end and was consistent with our ongoing efforts to expand
into significant markets around the world.
</p><!--l. 674--><p class="indent" >   I had few conversations with Mr.&#x00A0;Cohen on this subject. As I recall, they were brief,
and they were not memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall
any discussion of travel to Russia in connection with it. I do not remember discussing it
with anyone else at the Trump Organization, although it is possible. I do not recall being
aware at the time of any communications between Mr.&#x00A0;Cohen or Felix Sater and
any Russian government official regarding the Letter of Intent. In the course of
preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that Mr.&#x00A0;Cohen sent an
email regarding the Letter of Intent to Mr.&#x00A0;Peskov at a general, public email
account, which should show there was no meaningful relationship with people in
power in Russia. I understand those documents already have been provided to
you.
</p><!--l. 682--><p class="indent" >   I vaguely remember press inquiries and media reporting during the campaign
about whether the Trump Organization had business dealings in Russia. I may
have spoken with campaign staff or Trump Organization employees regarding
responses to requests for information, but I have no current recollection of any
particular conversation, with whom I may have spoken, when, or the substance of any
conversation. As I recall, neither I nor the Trump Organization had any projects
or proposed projects in Russia during the campaign other than the Letter of
Intent.

   of the Offense in which he acknowledged that the Foreign Agents Registration Act
   (FARA) documents he filed on March 7, 2017 contained materially false statements
   and omissions. Flynns plea occurred before the Special Counsel had made a final
   decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin. On March 27, 2018, after
   consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsels
   Office referred the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security
   Division (NSD) for any action it deemed appropriate. The Special Counsels Office
   determined the referral was appropriate because the investigation of Flynn had
   been completed, and that investigation had provided the rationale for the Offices
   investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin. At NSDs request, the Eastern District of
   Virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.

<span 
class="cmr-10">including making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, as described later</span>
<span

<span

<span

<span

<span

<span

<span

<span 
class="cmr-10">conversations with Cohen related to Cohen&#8217;s congressional testimony about Trump Tower</span>

<span

<span 
class="cmr-10">personal counsel&#8217;s uncertainty about the provenance of his own knowledge, the burden on a</span>
